magazine was just six years old when in the legendary irish band thin lizzy headlined the first ever rock festival in the natural amphitheatre of slane castle a stately pile of land sweeping down to the river boyne about miles from dublin that lizzy concert was notable too for the appearance further down the bill of a then rising young dublin fourpiece by the name of one year later in the summer of slane castles place on the international rock festival map as confirmed with an appearance by the rolling stones in front of a crowd estimated at strong since then the field below the castle has played host to many of the biggest names in rock including bruce springsteen queen rem guns n roses david bowie and perhaps most memorable of all themselves who returned home as worldconquering heroes to play two massive shows at the venue in but back in that level of success was still ahead of when bob dylan arrived in ireland to headline that years slane festival a friend of hot press as well as one of its cover stars since s inception frontman bono willingly donned a guest reporters hat to file this account of a backstage meeting with dylan and van morrison two veterans of the sixties who had briefly collaborated on stage that day during dylans performance and who clearly as the transcript reveals had some words of wisdom for a young singer who would himself go on to become one of the most recognizable rock icons of the and the new millennium bono you have been to ireland before havent youdylan yeah i was in belfast and in dublin and we travelled around a little bit toobono have you ever spent any time here have you ever been here on holidaydylan yeah well when i was here we travelled by car so we stayed in different placesbut irish music has always been a great part of my life because i used to hang out with the clancy brothers they influenced me tremendouslybono yeah they have so much balls as a sound you know when they sing its like punk rockdylan yeah they were playing clubs as big as this room right here and the placeyou couldnt put a pin in it it would be so packed with peoplebono you could smell their breathdylan yeahbono i bet you could they blow you over with their lungs god id love to sing like thatdylan yeah i spent years with them running around bono greenwich villagedylan all over the place i played on the same bill with them oncebono get their autographs laughsdylan no i didnt get their autograph but you know one of the things i recall from that time is how great they all werei mean there is no question but that they were great but liam clancy was always my favorite singer as a ballad singer i just never heard anyone as good and that includes barbara streisand and pearl baileybono you got to be careful heredylan hes just a phenomenal ballad singerbono yeah you know what i envy of you is that my music and the music of is like its in space somewhere there is no particular musical roots or heritage that we plug into in ireland there is a tradition but ive never plugged into it its like as if were caught in space theres a few groups now who are caught in spacedylan well you have to reach backbono we never did play a bardylan you have to reach theres another group i used to listen to called the mcpeake family i dont know if you ever heard of thembono the mcpeake family id love to have heard of them with a name like thatdylan they are great paddy clancy recorded them he had a label called tradition records and he used to bring back these records they recorded for prestige at the time and tradition records his company they were called the mcpeake family they were even more rural than the clancy brothers the clancy brothers had always that touch of commerciality to themyou didnt mind it but it was still there whereas the mcpeake family sang with harps the old man he played the harpand it was that gestures bigand the drumsbono were they a real familydylan yeah they were a real family if you go to a record store and as for a mcpeake family record i dont know im sure you could still get them in a lot of placesbono have you heard of an irish group that are working now in this middle ground between traditional and contemporary music called clannad clannad is gaelic for family and theyve made some very powerful pieces of music including a song called theme from harrys game its from a film and it knocked over everyone in europe it didnt get played in the us its just vocal and they used some low bass frequencies in it as wellits just beautiful theyre a family they come from donegal and have worked from that same base of traditional musicdylan theres a group you have here whats it called plankstonbono planxtydylan theyre greatbono another rocknroll banddylan yeah but when i think of whats happeningi think theyre greatbono theres another group called de dannan the name de dannan has something to do with with the lost tribes of dan you heard of the disappearing tribe of dan they say they came from irelanddylan yeah ive heard that ive heard thatbono im not a musicologist or expert in this area but it would appear that this is true also you know they say the irish musical scale has no roots in europe whatsoever rather it comes from africa and india the cartesian people the egyptian people what gave them supremacy in the middle east was the sail they developed i forget what they call it i forget the name of the sail but this sail allowed them to become successful sea farers and traders and they dominated as a result of their reading and that same sail which was used on those boats is used on the west of irelanddylan is that rightbono bob quinn made a film called atlanteans in which this theory was elaborated he suggests that the book of kells which is a manuscript part of it has its roots in coptic script not in europe its not a european thing at allits linked from africa spain brittany and ireland because that was a sea route im not an expert i shouldnt be talking about it really but its of interest when you think of itdylan sure it isbono i might be able to send you over some tapes of that actuallydylan id like to have them you know planxty i also like paul brady a lotbono yeah hes great hes a real song writer tell mehave you ever approached a microphone not with words but just to sing i had to do this as a necessity once when some lyrics of mine were stolenand i learnt to sing on the microphone just singing and working the words into it later i find when i put a pen in my hand it gets in the way do you have words firstdylan i do at certain timesbono in portland oregon a number of years ago two pretty girls walked in the dressing room smiled and walked out with some of our songs in a brief casedylan i used to have that happen to me all the time except they used to take clothesbono is that rightdylan they used to take all my best clothes but never took my songsbono after that we had to go in to record our second lp october without any songsthere was a lot of pressure having to sing under that stress without any words i found out a lot of things about myself that i didnt even know were there id wondered had some of the things that have come out of you ever been a surprise to youdylan that usually happens at concerts or shows im doing more than recording studios also i never sit around i usually play ill play my guitar rather than just have something to say to express myself i can express it better with my guitarbono i wondered had the songs that you were writing ever frightened you in some waydylan oh yeah ive written some songs that that did that the songs that i wrote for the slow train album did that i wrote those songs i didnt plan to write them but i wrote them anyway i didnt like writing them i didnt want to write them i didnt figure i just didnt want to write them songs at that period of time but i found myself writing these songs and after i had a certain amount of them i thought i didnt want to sing them so i had a girl sing them for me at the time and what i wanted to do was shes a great singer bono who is thisdylan a girl i was singing with at the time carolyn dennis her name was i gave them all to her and had her record them and not even put my name on them but i wanted the songs out i wanted them out but i didnt want to do it because i knew that it wouldnt be perceived in that way it would just mean more pressure i just did not want that at that timebono but are you a trouble maker is there something in you that wants trouble that an album like slow train stirs up do you wanna fight do you wanna boxdylan i dont know i mean i wanna piss people off once in a while but boxing or fightingit would be an exercise to do it you know i love to do it but not with anything at stakebono chess do you play chessdylan yeah i play chess are you a chess playerbono i am a chess playerdylan im not that good actuallybono ill challenge you to a game of chessdylan i dont have it right now actually i just dont have one on me but the next time you see mebono oh you can get these little ones you know that you can carry arounddylan yeah i take them on tour all the time but nobody in the band will play mebono reallydylan yeah they say its an ego trip they say i want to win i dont want to win i just like to playbono when you put out a record that causes troubleis it part of an overall plan or do you just do itdylan no i dont ever put out a record to cause troubleif it causes trouble it causes trouble thats apart from me if it causes trouble thats other peoples problem its not my problem im just not going to put out a record that i just feelyou know if i feel like im inspired to make a statement ill make that statement but what happens after i do it i dont care about thatbono whats your opening gamedylan my opening game you mean kings pawn up twoand all that i dont knowbono you just takes it as it comesdylan yeah i dont really play that seriouslybono well i thought i did until i played adams brother sebastianhe was only about years old and he beat medylan somebody may have a chess game herebono id love to playbono you havent used any synthesizers on your records so fardylan no ive never used those machinesbono the fairlight music computerhave you heard of thatdylan fairlightbono van what do you think of electronic musicmorrison i like the music brian eno playsbono he speaks very highly of you hes producing our record right nowmorrison say hellobono to bob do you know brian enodylan brian eno i dont know brian eno but i know some of his workbono when youre working with a producer do you give him the leeway to challenge youdylan yeah if he feels like it but usually we just go into the studio and sing a song and play the music and have you know bono have you had somebody in the last five years who said thats crap bobdylan oh they say that all the timebono mark knopfler did he say thatdylan i dont know they spend time getting their various songs right but with me i just take a song into the studio and try to rehearse it and then record it and then do it its a little harder now though to make a good recordeven if youve got a good song and a good band even if you go in and record it live its not gonna sound like it used to sound because the studios now are so modern and overly developed that you can take anything good and you can press it and squeeze it and squash it and constipate it and suffocate it you do a great performance in the studio and you listen back to it because the speakers are all so good but ah nobono all technology does isyou go into a dead room with dead instruments and you use technology to give it life that it doesnt have and then it comes out of the speakers and you believe it what ive been trying to do is find a room that has life in itselfdylan yeahbono a living roomdylan the machines though can even take the life out of that room ive found you can record in st peters cathedral you know and they still make it sound like eh bono somebodys backyarddylan yeahdylan thats a good idea id love to record in a cathedraldylan you know the studios in the old days were all much better and the equipment so much better theres no question about it in my mind you just walked into a studio they were just big rooms you just sang you know you just made records and they sounded like the way they sounded there that stopped happening in the late sixties for me anyway i noticed the big change you go into a studio now and they got rugs on the floor settees and pinball machines and videos and sandwiches coming every ten minutes its a big expensive party and youre lucky if you come out with anything that sounds decentbono yeah records havent got better have theydylan no you go in now you got your producer you got your engineer you got your assistant engineer usually your assistant producer you got a guy carrying the tapes around i mean you know theres a million people go into recording just an acoustic song on your guitar the boys turn the machines on and its a great undertakingbono theres a system called effanel which mick fleetwood from fleetwood mac brought to africa it was built for him because he wanted to get some real african drummin for tusk weve used that system it comes in a light suitcase very small no bullshit studio and it just arrives you can literally bring it to your living roommorrison i think all the same theyll go back to eventuallybono theres a guy called conny plank who lives in germany hes a producer i think he produced makem and clancy and some irish traditional bands also orchestral and funnily enough a lot of the new electronic groups daf ultravox and so on he used to record orchestras by just finding a position in the room where they were already balanced and he applies this in his thinking in recording modern music he finds a place in the room where its already mixedmorrison i dont know when i started we didnt think about that you didnt even think about recording laughsbono you didnt even thinkmorrison you didnt even know what was on the cards one day you were in the room they turned the tape on after about eight hours or so theyd say ok tea break its overdylan yeah next song next songmorrison and that was thatit was an albumdylan yeah youd make an album on three days or four days and it was overif that many its that long now it takes four days to get a drum soundbono do you know the monty python team theyre comedians british comedians monty python and the holy grail they have a sketch that reminds me of you guyssitting back talking of days gone by you tell that to the young people of today and theyd never believe you but you cant go backwards you must go forward you try to bring the values that were back there you know the strength and if you see something that was lost you got to find a new way to capture that same strength have you any idea of how to do that i think youve done it by the way i think shot of love that opening track has thatdylan i think so too youre one of the few people to say that to me about that record to mention that record to mebono that has that feelingdylan its a great record it suits just about everybodybono the sound from that record makes me feel like im in the same room as the other musicians i dont feel like theyre over there some of our records i feel like theyre over there because we got into this cinema type sound not bland like fm sound but we got into this very broad sound now were trying to focus more of a punch and thats what we are after this intimacy ive never interviewed anybody before by the way i hate being interviewed myselfmorrison youre doing a good jobbono is this ok good what records do you listen todylan what records do i listen to new records i dont know just the old records really robert johnson i still listen to those records that i listened to when i was growing upthey really changed my life they still change my life they still hold up you know the louvain brothers hank williams muddy waters howlin wolf charlie patton i always liked to listen to himbono i just bought woody guthries bound for glory im just a beginner when it comes to america i mean its changed me when you go the us coming from this country its more than a different continent morrison its shell shockbono yeah coming from troubled ireland its the real shell shock im just getting acquainted with american music and literature do you still see allen ginsbergdylan i run across allen from time to time yeah gregory corsoss back now hes doing some readings i think hes just published a new bookbono ive just been reading this book howldylan oh thats very powerful thats another book that changed me howl on the road dharma bumsmorrison to bono have you read on the roadbono yes i have im just starting that you have a reference in one of your songs to john donne rave on john donne have you read his poetrymorrison i was reading it at the timedylan

brendans son hang out around here in dublin hes a good guy i believedylan i know the solo lyrics to the royal canal i used to sing it all the timebono how does it godylan sings the hungry feeling came over me stealing as the mice were squalling in my prison cellbono thats right yeahdylan continues that old triangle went jingle jangle all along the banks of the royal canalbono thats right when did you read thatdylan theres no way stopping him now in the female prison theres seventy women its all over there that i want to dwell and that old triangle goes jingle jangle all along the banks of the royal canalbono have you been to the royal canaldylan no i used to sing that song though every nightbono our musicas i was saying earlierit doesnt have those rootsmorrison yeah there was a break in the lineage i sussed that out when i went to see thin lizzy years ago the first night in la and i was watching at the back of the stage and i realized that the music was a complete cut in the connection between the end of the sixties and the middle of the seventiesa severing of the traditional lineage of groupsbono i like to know more about roots music im hungry for a pastmorrison you know you should listen to some of that stuffbono i will ive been listening to some gospel music you know like the swan silvertones and stuff like thatdylan thats us stuff thoughmorrison us stuff but the british stuff you should listen to you know like some of the old stuff like the yardbirdsbono yeah ive got some of their tapes recently some real good tapesdylan you can still hear the mcpeakes the next generation may not be able to though who knows i would hate to think that listen were gonna have to get ready to play are you gonna stay for the showbono certainly thats what im here for

duets his career was remarkable for both its longevity and its consistencyby bruce webertony bennett a singer whose melodic clarity jazzinfluenced phrasing audienceembracing persona and warm deceptively simple interpretations of musical standards helped spread the american songbook around the world and won him generations of fans died on friday at his home in manhattan where he had lived for many decades he was his publicist sylvia weiner announced his deathmr bennett learned he had alzheimers disease in his wife susan bennett told aarp the magazine in february he continued to perform and record despite his illness his last public performance was in august when he appeared with lady gaga at radio city music hall in a show titled one last timemr bennetts career of more than years was remarkable not only for its longevity but also for its consistency in hundreds of concerts and club dates and more than recordings he devoted himself to preserving the classic american popular song as written by cole porter the gershwins duke ellington rodgers and hammerstein and othersfrom his initial success as a jazzy crooner who wowed audiences at the paramount in times square in the early through his lateinlife duets with younger singers gleaned from a range of genres and generations  most notably lady gaga with whom he recorded albums in and and toured in  he was an active promoter of both songwriting and entertaining as timeless noble pursuitsmr bennett stubbornly resisted record producers who urged gimmick songs on him or in the and early who were sure that rock n roll had relegated the music he preferred to a dusty bin perused only by a dwindling population of the elderly and nostalgicinstead he followed in the musical path of the greatest american pop singers of the century  louis armstrong bing crosby judy garland billie holiday frank sinatra  and carried the torch for them into the he reached the height of stardom in with a celebrated concert at carnegie hall and the release of his signature song i left my heart in san francisco and though he saw his popularity wane with the onset of rock and his career went through a trough in the when professional difficulties were exacerbated by a failing marriage and drug problems he was in the end more than vindicated in his musical judgmenti wanted to sing the great songs songs that i felt really mattered to people he said in the good life an autobiography written with will friedwaldits hard to overstate mr bennetts lasting appeal he was still singing san francisco  which led many people to think he was a native of that city though he was actually a throughandthrough new yorker  more than half a century later he sang on ed sullivans show and david lettermans he sang with rosemary clooney when she was in her and celine dion when she was in her editors picksnew zealands fruitrich ice cream gets a sugary american makeovergretchen whitmer would like you to meet governor barbiethe perpetual stew is more about community than cuisinehe made his film debut in in a critically reviled hollywood story the oscar playing a man betrayed by an old friend and though he did not pursue an acting career decades later he was playing himself in movies like the robert de nirobilly crystal gangster comedy analyze this and the jim carrey vehicle bruce almighty he was when he appeared as a cartoon version of himself on the simpsons he was when he appeared on the hbo series entourage performing one of his trademark songs the good lifea lifelong liberal democrat mr bennett participated in the selmatomontgomery civil rights march in and along with harry belafonte sammy davis jr and others performed at the stars for freedom rally on the city of st jude campus on the outskirts of montgomery on march the night before the rev dr martin luther king jr delivered the address that came to be known as the how long not long speech at the conclusion of the march viola liuzzo a volunteer from michigan drove mr bennett to the airport she was murdered later that day by members of the ku klux klanmr bennett also performed for nelson mandela then the president of south africa during his state visit to england in he sang at the white house for john f kennedy and bill clinton and at buckingham palace at queen elizabeth iis anniversary jubileean elusive voicehe won his first two grammy awards for san francisco in and his last for the album love for sale with lady gaga last year altogether there were of them including in a lifetime achievement award by some estimates he sold more than million recordsthe talent that spawned this success and popularity was not so easy to define neither a fluid singer nor an especially powerful one he did not have the mellifluous timbre of crosby or the rakish swing of sinatra if armstrongs tone was distinctively gravelly mr bennetts wasnt quite sandy was more like it almost no one denied that his voice was appealing but critics strove mightily to describe it and then to justify its appealthe voice that is the basic tool of mr bennetts trade is small thin and somewhat hoarse john s wilson wrote in the new york times in but he uses it shrewdly and with a skillful lack of pretensionin a profile whitney balliett the longtime jazz critic for the new yorker called mr bennett an elusive singerhe can be a belter who reaches rocking fortissimos mr balliett wrote he drives a ballad as intensely and intimately as sinatra he can be a lilting glancing jazz singer he can be a lowkey searching supperclub performer but he added bennetts voice binds all his vocal selves togethermost simply perhaps the composer and critic alec wilder said about mr bennetts voice there is a quality about it that lets you inindeed what many listeners including the critics discovered about mr bennett and what they responded to was something intangible the care with which he treated both the song and the audiencehe had a storytellers grace with a lyric a jazzmans sureness with a melody and in his finest performances he delivered them with a party givers welcome a palpable and infectious affability in his presentation the songs he loved and sang  just in time the best is yet to come rags to riches and i wanna be around to name a handful of his emblematic hits  became engaging lifeembracing parablesfrank sinatra whom mr bennett counted as a mentor and friend once put it another wayfor my money tony bennett is the best singer in the business he told life magazine in he excites me when i watch him he moves me hes the singer who gets across what the composer has in mind and probably a little moremr bennett passed through life with as unscathed a public image as it is possible for a celebrity to have finding even mild criticism of him in reviews and interviews is no mean feat and even his outspoken liberalism generally failed to attract vitriol from the right an exception was his call after the drugrelated deaths of michael jackson amy winehouse and whitney houston for the legalization of drugs a view loudly denounced by william j bennett the former drug czar among otherswith the possible exception of his former wives everyone it seemed loved tony bennett skeptical journalists would occasionally try to pierce what they perceived as his perfect veneer but they generally discovered that there wasnt much to piercebennett is outrageous simon hattenstone a reporter for the guardian wrote in he mythologizes himself namedrops every time he opens his mouth directs you to his altruism is selfcongratulatory to the point of indecency he should be intolerable but hes one of the sweetest most humble men ive ever metson of queensanthony dominick benedetto was born on aug in the long island city neighborhood of queens and grew up in that borough in workingclass astoria his father giovanni had emigrated from calabria in southern italy at age departing just two days before the eruption of mount vesuvius in

the family anthony was their third child their second son and the first of any benedetto to be born in a hospital giovanni who sang italian folk songs to his children  my father inspired my love for music mr bennett wrote in his autobiography  died when anthony was anthony sang from an early age and drew and painted too he would become a creditable painter as an adult mostly landscapes and still lifes in watercolors and oils and portraits of musicians he admired signing his paintings benedetto his first music teacher arranged for him to sing alongside mayor fiorello la guardia at the opening of the triborough bridge now the robert f kennedy bridge in for a time he attended the high school for industrial arts now called the high school of art and design in manhattan but he never graduated he dropped out and found work as a copy boy for the associated press in a laundry and as an elevator operatori couldnt figure out how to get the elevator to stop at the right place he recalled people ended up having to crawl out between floorsat night he performed at amateur shows and worked as a singing waiter he had just begun to get paying work as a singer using the stage name joe bari when he was draftedhe arrived in europe toward the end of world war ii serving in germany in the infantry he spent time on the front lines an experience he described as a frontrow seat in hell and was among the troops who arrived to liberate the prisoners at the landsberg concentration camp a subcamp of dachauafter germany surrendered mr bennett was part of the occupying forces assigned to special services where he ended up as a singer with army bands and for a time was featured in a ragtag version of the musical on the town  directed by arthur penn who would go on to direct bonnie and clyde and other notable movies  in the opera house in wiesbadenhe returned to new york in august and set about beginning a career as a musician on the gi bill he took classes at the american theater wing which he later said helped teach him how to tell a story in song he sang in nightclubs in manhattan and queensa series of breaks followed he appeared on the radio show arthur godfreys talent scouts the american idol of its day the competition was won by rosemary clooney there are different versions of the biggest break in mr bennetts early career but as he told it in the good life he had been singing occasionally at a club in greenwich village where the owner had offered pearl bailey a gig as the headliner she agreed but only on the condition that joe bari stayed on the billwhen bob hope came down to take in ms baileys act he liked joe bari so much that he asked him to open for him at the paramount theater hope had a condition however he didnt like the name joe bari and insisted it be changed dismissing the name anthony benedetto as too long to fit on a marquee hope christened the young singer tony bennettthe hits roll inthe producer mitch miller signed mr bennett to columbia records in boulevard of broken dreams was his first single miller was known for his hitmaking prowess a gift that often involved matching talented singers with novelty songs or having them cover hits by others for which he was criticized by more serious music fans and sometimes by the singers themselveshe and mr bennett had a contentious relationship mr bennett resisted his attempts at gimmickry miller who believed that the producer and not the singer was in charge of a recording applied his authority still together they achieved grand successby mr bennett had his first no hit because of you that same year his version of the hank williams ballad cold cold heart also hit no three years after williams died in mr bennett performed it in his honor at the grand ole opry in nashvilleother trademark songs followed rags to riches in stranger in paradise from the broadway show kismet also in jule styne and sammy cahns just in time from the show bells are ringing in that same year mr bennett was host of his own television variety show a summer replacement for a similar show that starred another popular italian american crooner perry como in he recorded two albums with the count basie band introducing him to the jazz audiencein the mr bennett toured for the first time played las vegas for the first time and got married for the first time to patricia beech a fan who had seen him perform in cleveland the marriage would founder in the overwhelmed by mr bennetts perpetual touring but their two sons would end up playing roles in mr bennetts career the older one dandrea known as danny became his fathers manager and daegal known as dae became a music producer and recording engineerin july mr bennett was performing in hot springs ark and about to head to the west coast when ralph sharon his longtime pianist played him a song written by george cory and douglass cross that had been moldering in a drawer for two years mr sharon and mr bennett decided that it would be perfect for their next date at the fairmont hotel in san francisco and it wasthey recorded the song  of course it was i left my heart in san francisco  six months later in january it won mr bennett his first two grammys for best male solo performance and record of the year and worldwide fame in the good life he wrote that he was often asked if he ever tired of singing iti answer do you ever get tired of making love he wrotejust five months later mr bennett performed at carnegie hall with mr sharon and a small orchestra he got sensational reviews  though the timess was measured  and the recording of the concert is now considered a classicbut as the proceeded and rock n roll became dominant mr bennetts popularity began to slip in he succumbed to the pressure of the new president of columbia records clive davis to record his versions of contemporary songs and the result tony sings the great hits of today  including the beatles eleanor rigby and something  was a musical calamity a record that mr bennett would later tell an interviewer made him vomithis relationship with columbia soured further and finally ended and by the middle of the mr bennett had formed his own company improv records on which he recorded the first of two of his most critically admired albums duets with the jazz pianist bill evans the second one was released on evanss label fantasy together the two opened the newport jazz festival which had moved to new york at carnegie hall in improv went out of business in and without a recording contract mr bennett relied more and more on las vegas then in decline for regular work his mother died that year and the profligate life he had been living in beverly hills caught up with him the internal revenue service was threatening to take his house his second marriage a tumultuous one to the actress sandra grant collapsed  she would later say that she would have been better off if she had married her previous boyfriend joe dimaggio  and he had begun using marijuana and cocaine heavilyone day in high and in a panic he took a bath to calm down and nearly died in the tub in later years he would play down the seriousness of the event but he wrote about it in the good life describing what he called a neardeath experience a golden light enveloped me in a warm glow it was quite peaceful in fact i had the sense that i was about to embark on a very compelling journey but suddenly i was jolted out of the vision the tub was overflowing and sandra was standing above me shed heard the water running for too long and when she came in i wasnt breathing she pounded on my chest and literally brought me back to lifemr bennett turned to his older son for help danny bennett took over the management of his career aiming to have the american musical standards that were his strength and his handling of them perceived as hip by a new generationsomewhat surprisingly the strategy took hold an article in spin magazine which was founded in declared mr bennett and james brown as the two foremost influences on rock n roll and the magazine followed up with a long admiring profilea career revivalencouraged by executive changes at columbia records mr bennett returned to the columbia fold in the next year he released the album the art of excellence wbcn in boston became the first rock station to give it regular airplay released in the emerging cd

an entirely new audiencehe recorded albums that honored musicians he admired  duke ellington louis armstrong frank sinatra and billie holiday  and he collaborated on standards with singers half or less than half his age on the album duets an american classic he sang if i ruled the world with ms dion smile with barbra streisand and for once in my life with stevie wonder and revisited his first columbia single boulevard of broken dreams with sting five years later on duets ii his collaborators included aretha franklin queen latifah willie nelson and ms winehouseas the century changed he was

survived by his wife his sons danny and dae his daughters johanna and antonia bennett and grandchildrenif there was a magical quality to mr bennetts life as suggested by david evanier in a glowing biography all the things you are the life of tony bennett it is encapsulated by a story mr bennett told to whitney balliett in i like the funny things in life that could only happen to me now he said once when i was singing kurt weills lost in the stars in the hollywood bowl with basies band and buddy rich on drums a shooting star went falling through the sky right over my head and everyone was
