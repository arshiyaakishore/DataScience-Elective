        "1. **TextBlob Module:** Linguistic researchers have labeled the sentiment of words based on their domain expertise. Sentiment of words can vary based on where it is in a sentence. The TextBlob module allows us to take advantage of these labels.\n",
        "2. **Sentiment Labels:** Each word in a corpus is labeled in terms of polarity and subjectivity (there are more labels as well, but we're going to ignore them for now). A corpus' sentiment is the average of these.\n",
        "   * **Polarity**: How positive or negative a word is. -1 is very negative. +1 is very positive.\n",
        "   * **Subjectivity**: How subjective, or opinionated a word is. 0 is fact. +1 is very much an opinion.\n",

Roderick\\u2019s twin sister, Madeline, is gravely ill with a mysterious condition that leaves her cataleptic. The narrative unfolds in a gloomy atmosphere, filled with foreboding and supernatural elements, as the narrator witnesses the psychological disintegration of Roderick and the bizarre events leading up to Madeline\\u2019s death and terrifying return from the grave. The story culminates in the literal and metaphorical collapse of the Usher house into the dark tarn that mirrors it, symbolizing the end of the Usher family line and the inescapable doom of their ancient curse. Poe masterfully weaves themes of fear, isolation, and madness, creating a quintessential Gothic tale that explores the depths of human despair and the fragility of the psyche.\\n* * *\\nby Edgar Allan Poe\\nSon c\\u0153ur est un luth suspendu;\\nSit\\u00f4t qu\\u2019on le touche il r\\u00e9sonne.\\n\\u2014De B\\u00e9ranger.1\\nDuring the whole of a dull, dark, and soundless day in the autumn of the year, when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens, I had been passing alone, on horseback, through a singularly dreary tract of country; and at length found myself, as the shades of the evening drew on, within view of the melancholy House of Usher. I know not how it was \\u2013 but, with the first glimpse of the building, a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit. I say insufferable; for the feeling was unrelieved by any of that half-pleasurable, because poetic, sentiment, with which the mind usually receives even the sternest natural images of the desolate or terrible. I looked upon the scene before me \\u2013 upon the mere house, and the simple landscape features of the domain \\u2013 upon the bleak walls \\u2013 upon the vacant eye-like windows \\u2013 upon a few rank sedges \\u2013 and upon a few white trunks of decayed trees \\u2013 with an utter depression of soul which I can compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the after-dream of the reveller upon opium \\u2013 the bitter lapse into everyday life \\u2013 the hideous dropping off of the veil. There was an iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the heart \\u2013 an unredeemed dreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could torture into aught of the sublime. What was it \\u2013 I paused to think \\u2013 what was it that so unnerved me in the contemplation of the House of Usher? It was a mystery all insoluble; nor could I grapple with the shadowy fancies that crowded upon me as I pondered. I was forced to fall back upon the unsatisfactory conclusion, that while, beyond doubt, there are combinations of very simple natural objects which have the power of thus affecting us, still the analysis of this power lies among considerations beyond our depth. It was possible, I reflected, that a mere different arrangement of the particulars of the scene, of the details of the picture, would be sufficient to modify, or perhaps to annihilate its capacity for sorrowful impression; and, acting upon this idea, I reined my horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in unruffled lustre by the dwelling, and gazed down \\u2013 but with a shudder even more thrilling than before \\u2013 upon the remodelled and inverted images of the gray sedge, and the ghastly tree-stems, and the vacant and eye-like windows.\\nNevertheless, in this mansion of gloom I now proposed to myself a\\u00a0sojourn\\u00a0of some weeks. Its proprietor, Roderick Usher, had been one of my boon companions in boyhood; but many years had elapsed since our last meeting. A letter, however, had lately reached me in a distant part of the country \\u2013 a letter from him \\u2013 which, in its wildly importunate nature, had admitted of no other than a personal reply. The MS. gave evidence of nervous agitation. The writer spoke of\\u00a0acute\\u00a0bodily illness \\u2013 of a mental disorder which oppressed him \\u2013 and of an earnest desire to see me, as his best, and indeed his only personal friend, with a view of attempting, by the cheerfulness of my society, some alleviation of his malady. It was the manner in which all this, and much more, was said \\u2013 it the apparent heart that went with his request \\u2013 which allowed me no room for hesitation; and I accordingly obeyed forthwith what I still considered a very singular summons.\\nAlthough, as boys, we had been even intimate associates, yet I really knew little of my friend. His reserve had been always excessive and habitual. I was aware, however, that his very ancient family had been noted, time out of mind, for a peculiar sensibility of temperament, displaying itself, through long ages, in many works of exalted art, and manifested, of late, in repeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive charity, as well as in a passionate devotion to the intricacies, perhaps even more than to the orthodox and easily recognisable beauties, of musical science. I had learned, too, the very remarkable fact, that the stem of the Usher race, all time-honoured as it was, had put forth, at no period, any enduring branch; in other words, that the entire family lay in the direct line of descent, and had always, with very trifling and very temporary variation, so lain. It was this deficiency, I considered, while running over in thought the perfect keeping of the character of the premises with the accredited character of the people, and while speculating upon the possible influence which the one, in the long lapse of centuries, might have exercised upon the other \\u2013 it was this deficiency, perhaps, of collateral issue, and the consequent undeviating transmission, from sire to son, of the patrimony with the name, which had, at length, so identified the two as to merge the original title of the estate in the quaint and\\u00a0equivocal\\u00a0appellation of the \\u201cHouse of Usher\\u201d \\u2013 an appellation which seemed to include, in the minds of the peasantry who used it, both the family and the family mansion.\\nI have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish experiment \\u2013 that of looking down within the\\u00a0tarn \\u2013 had been to deepen the first singular impression. There can be no doubt that the consciousness of the rapid increase of my superstition \\u2013 for why should I not so term it? \\u2013 served mainly to accelerate the increase itself. Such, I have long known, is the\\u00a0paradoxical\\u00a0law of all sentiments having terror as a basis. And it might have been for this reason only, that, when I again uplifted my eyes to the house itself, from its image in the pool, there grew in my mind a strange fancy \\u2013 a fancy so ridiculous, indeed, that I but mention it to show the vivid force of the sensations which oppressed me. I had so worked upon my imagination as really to believe that about the whole mansion and domain there hung an atmosphere peculiar to themselves and their immediate vicinity-an atmosphere which had no affinity with the air of heaven, but which had reeked up from the decayed trees, and the gray wall, and the silent\\u00a0tarn \\u2013 a pestilent and mystic vapour, dull, sluggish, faintly discernible, and leaden-hued.\\nShaking off from my spirit what must have been a dream, I scanned more narrowly the real aspect of the building. Its principal feature seemed to be that of an excessive antiquity. The discoloration of ages had been great. Minute fungi overspread the whole exterior, hanging in a fine tangled web-work from the eaves. Yet all this was apart from any extraordinary dilapidation. No portion of the masonry had fallen; and there appeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfect adaptation of parts, and the crumbling condition of the individual stones. In this there was much that reminded me of the specious totality of old wood-work which has rotted for long years in some neglected vault, with no disturbance from the breath of the external air. Beyond this indication of extensive decay, however, the fabric gave little token of instability. Perhaps the eye of a scrutinising observer might have discovered a barely perceptible fissure, which, extending from the roof of the building in front, made its way down the wall in a zigzag direction, until it became lost in the\\u00a0sullen\\u00a0waters of the\\u00a0tarn.\\nNoticing these things, I rode over a short causeway to the house. A servant in waiting took my horse, and I entered the Gothic archway of the hall. A valet, of stealthy step, thence conducted me, in silence, through many dark and intricate passages in my progress to the studio of his master. Much that I encountered on the way contributed, I know not how, to heighten the vague sentiments of which I have already spoken. While the objects around me \\u2013 while the carvings of the ceilings, the sombre tapestries of the walls, the ebon blackness of the floors, and the\\u00a0phantasmagoric\\u00a0armorial trophies which rattled as I strode, were but matters to which, or to such as which, I had been accustomed from my infancy \\u2013 while I hesitated not to acknowledge how familiar was all this \\u2013 I still wondered to find how unfamiliar were the fancies which ordinary images were stirring up. On one of the staircases, I met the physician of the family. His countenance, I thought, wore a mingled expression of low cunning and perplexity. He accosted me with\\u00a0trepidation\\u00a0and passed on. The valet now threw open a door and ushered me into the presence of his master.\\nThe room in which I found myself was very large and lofty. The windows were long, narrow, and pointed, and at so vast a distance from the black oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible from within. Feeble gleams of encrimsoned light made their way through the trellised panes, and served to render sufficiently distinct the more prominent objects around; the eye, however, struggled in vain to reach the remoter angles of the chamber, or the recesses of the vaulted and fretted ceiling. Dark draperies hung upon the walls. The general furniture was profuse, comfortless, antique, and tattered. Many books and musical instruments lay scattered about, but failed to give any vitality to the scene. I felt that I breathed an atmosphere of sorrow. An air of stern, deep, and irredeemable gloom hung over and pervaded all.\\nUpon my entrance, Usher arose from a sofa on which he had been lying at full length, and greeted me with a vivacious warmth which had much in it, I at first thought, of an overdone cordiality \\u2013 of the constrained effort of the ennuy\\u00e9 man of the world. A glance, however, at his countenance, convinced me of his perfect sincerity. We sat down; and for some moments, while he spoke not, I gazed upon him with a feeling half of pity, half of awe. Surely, man had never before so terribly altered, in so brief a period, as had Roderick Usher! It was with difficulty that I could bring myself to admit the identity of the wan being before me with the companion of my early boyhood. Yet the character of his face had been at all times remarkable. A cadaverousness of complexion; an eye large, liquid, and luminous beyond comparison; lips somewhat thin and very pallid, but of a surpassingly beautiful curve; a nose of a delicate Hebrew model, but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations; a finely moulded chin, speaking, in its want of prominence, of a want of moral energy; hair of a more than web-like softness and tenuity; these features, with an inordinate expansion above the regions of the temple, made up altogether a countenance not easily to be forgotten. And now in the mere exaggeration of the prevailing character of these features, and of the expression they were wont to convey, lay so much of change that I doubted to whom I spoke. The now ghastly pallor of the skin, and the now miraculous lustre of the eve, above all things startled and even awed me. The silken hair, too, had been suffered to grow all unheeded, and as, in its wild gossamer texture, it floated rather than fell about the face, I could not, even with effort, connect its Arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity.\\nIn the manner of my friend I was at once struck with an incoherence \\u2013 an inconsistency; and I soon found this to arise from a series of feeble and futile struggles to overcome an habitual trepidancy \\u2013 an excessive nervous agitation. For something of this nature I had indeed been prepared, no less by his letter, than by reminiscences of certain boyish traits, and by conclusions deduced from his peculiar physical conformation and temperament. His action was alternately vivacious and\\u00a0sullen. His voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision (when the animal spirits seemed utterly in\\u00a0abeyance) to that species of energetic concision \\u2013 that abrupt, weighty, unhurried, and hollow-sounding enunciation \\u2013 that leaden, self-balanced and perfectly modulated guttural utterance, which may be observed in the lost drunkard, or the irreclaimable eater of opium, during the periods of his most intense excitement.\\nIt was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit, of his earnest desire to see me, and of the solace he expected me to afford him. He entered, at some length, into what he conceived to be the nature of his malady. It was, he said, a constitutional and a family evil, and one for which he despaired to find a remedy \\u2013 a mere nervous affection, he immediately added, which would undoubtedly soon pass off. It displayed itself in a host of unnatural sensations. Some of these, as he detailed them, interested and bewildered me; although, perhaps, the terms, and the general manner of the narration had their weight. He suffered much from a morbid acuteness of the senses; the most insipid food was alone endurable; he could wear only garments of certain texture; the odours of all flowers were oppressive; his eyes were tortured by even a faint light; and there were but peculiar sounds, and these from stringed instruments, which did not inspire him with horror.\\nTo an\\u00a0anomalous\\u00a0species of terror I found him a bounden slave. \\u201cI shall perish,\\u201d said he, \\u201cI must perish in this deplorable folly. Thus, thus, and not otherwise, shall I be lost. I dread the events of the future, not in themselves, but in their results. I shudder at the thought of any, even the most trivial, incident, which may operate upon this intolerable agitation of soul. I have, indeed, no abhorrence of danger, except in its absolute effect \\u2013 in terror. In this unnerved-in this pitiable condition \\u2013 I feel that the period will sooner or later arrive when I must abandon life and reason together, in some struggle with the grim\\u00a0phantasm, FEAR.\\u201d\\nI learned, moreover, at intervals, and through broken and\\u00a0equivocal\\u00a0hints, another singular feature of his mental condition. He was enchained by certain superstitious impressions in regard to the dwelling which he tenanted, and whence, for many years, he had never ventured forth \\u2013 in regard to an influence whose supposititious force was conveyed in terms too shadowy here to be re-stated \\u2013 an influence which some peculiarities in the mere form and substance of his family mansion, had, by\\u00a0dint\\u00a0of long sufferance, he said, obtained over his spirit-an effect which the physique of the gray walls and turrets, and of the dim\\u00a0tarn\\u00a0into which they all looked down, had, at length, brought about upon the morale of his existence.\\nHe admitted, however, although with hesitation, that much of the peculiar gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a more natural and far more\\u00a0palpable\\u00a0origin \\u2013 to the severe and long-continued illness \\u2013 indeed to the evidently approaching dissolution-of a tenderly beloved sister \\u2013 his sole companion for long years \\u2013 his last and only relative on earth. \\u201cHer decease,\\u201d he said, with a bitterness which I can never forget, \\u201cwould leave him (him the hopeless and the frail) the last of the ancient race of the Ushers.\\u201d While he spoke, the lady Madeline (for so was she called) passed slowly through a remote portion of the apartment, and, without having noticed my presence, disappeared. I regarded her with an utter astonishment not unmingled with dread \\u2013 and yet I found it impossible to account for such feelings. A sensation of stupor oppressed me, as my eyes followed her retreating steps. When a door, at length, closed upon her, my glance sought instinctively and eagerly the countenance of the brother \\u2013 but he had buried his face in his hands, and I could only perceive that a far more than ordinary wanness had overspread the emaciated fingers through which trickled many passionate tears.\\nThe disease of the lady Madeline had long baffled the skill of her physicians. A settled apathy, a gradual wasting away of the person, and frequent although transient affections of a partially\\u00a0cataleptical\\u00a0character, were the unusual diagnosis. Hitherto she had steadily borne up against the pressure of her malady, and had not betaken herself finally to bed; but, on the closing in of the evening of my arrival at the house, she succumbed (as her brother told me at night with inexpressible agitation) to the prostrating power of the destroyer; and I learned that the glimpse I had obtained of her person would thus probably be the last I should obtain \\u2013 that the lady, at least while living, would be seen by me no more.\\nFor several days ensuing, her name was unmentioned by either Usher or myself: and during this period I was busied in earnest endeavours to alleviate the melancholy of my friend. We painted and read together; or I listened, as if in a dream, to the wild improvisations of his speaking guitar. And thus, as a closer and still intimacy admitted me more unreservedly into the recesses of his spirit, the more bitterly did I perceive the futility of all attempt at cheering a mind from which darkness, as if an inherent positive quality, poured forth upon all objects of the moral and physical universe, in one unceasing radiation of gloom.\\nI shall ever bear about me a memory of the many solemn hours I thus spent alone with the master of the House of Usher. Yet I should fail in any attempt to convey an idea of the exact character of the studies, or of the occupations, in which he involved me, or led me the way. An excited and highly distempered ideality threw a\\u00a0sulphureous\\u00a0lustre over all. His long improvised dirges will ring forever in my ears. Among other things, I hold painfully in mind a certain singular perversion and amplification of the wild air of the last waltz of Von Weber. From the paintings over which his elaborate fancy brooded, and which grew, touch by touch, into vaguenesses at which I shuddered the more thrillingly, because I shuddered knowing not why; \\u2013 from these paintings (vivid as their images now are before me) I would in vain endeavour to educe more than a small portion which should lie within the compass of merely written words. By the utter simplicity, by the nakedness of his designs, he arrested and overawed attention. If ever mortal painted an idea, that mortal was Roderick Usher. For me at least \\u2013 in the circumstances then surrounding me \\u2013 there arose out of the pure abstractions which the hypochondriac contrived to throw upon his canvas, an intensity of intolerable awe, no shadow of which felt I ever yet in the contemplation of the certainly glowing yet too concrete reveries of\\u00a0Fuseli.\\nOne of the\\u00a0phantasmagoric\\u00a0conceptions of my friend, partaking not so rigidly of the spirit of abstraction, may be shadowed forth, although feebly, in words. A small picture presented the interior of an immensely long and rectangular vault or tunnel, with low walls, smooth, white, and without interruption or device. Certain accessory points of the design served well to convey the idea that this excavation lay at an exceeding depth below the surface of the earth. No outlet was observed in any portion of its vast extent, and no torch, or other artificial source of light was discernible; yet a flood of intense rays rolled throughout, and bathed the whole in a ghastly and inappropriate splendour.\\nI have just spoken of that morbid condition of the auditory nerve which rendered all music intolerable to the sufferer, with the exception of certain effects of stringed instruments. It was, perhaps, the narrow limits to which he thus confined himself upon the guitar, which gave birth, in great measure, to the fantastic character of his performances. But the fervid facility of his impromptus could not be so accounted for. They must have been, and were, in the notes, as well as in the words of his wild fantasias (for he not unfrequently accompanied himself with rhymed verbal improvisations), the result of that intense mental collectedness and concentration to which I have previously alluded as observable only in particular moments of the highest artificial excitement. The words of one of these rhapsodies I have easily remembered. I was, perhaps, the more forcibly impressed with it, as he gave it, because, in the under or mystic current of its meaning, I fancied that I perceived, and for the first time, a full consciousness on the part of Usher, of the tottering of his lofty reason upon her throne. The verses, which were entitled \\u201cThe Haunted Palace,\\u201d ran very nearly, if not accurately, thus:\\nI.\\nIn the greenest of our valleys,\\nBy good angels tenanted,\\nOnce fair and stately palace \\u2013\\nRadiant palace \\u2013 reared its head.\\nIn the monarch Thought\\u2019s dominion \\u2013\\nIt stood there!\\nNever seraph spread a pinion\\nOver fabric half so fair.\\nII.\\n\\n\\n\\nBanners yellow, glorious, golden,\\nOn its roof did float and flow;\\n(This \\u2013 all this \\u2013 was in the olden\\nTime long ago)\\nAnd every gentle air that dallied,\\nIn that sweet day,\\nAlong the ramparts plumed and\\u00a0pallid,\\nA winged odour went away.\\nIII.\\nWanderers in that happy valley\\nThrough two luminous windows saw\\nSpirits moving musically\\nTo a lute\\u2019s well-tuned law,\\nRound about a throne, where sitting\\n(Porphyrogene!)\\nIn state his glory well befitting,\\nThe ruler of the realm was seen.\\nIV.\\nAnd all with pearl and ruby glowing\\nWas the fair palace door,\\nThrough which came flowing, flowing, flowing\\nAnd sparkling evermore,\\nA troop of Echoes whose sweet duty\\nWas but to sing,\\nIn voices of surpassing beauty,\\nThe wit and wisdom of their king.\\nV.\\nBut evil things, in robes of sorrow,\\nAssailed the monarch\\u2019s high estate;\\n(Ah, let us mourn, for never morrow\\nShall dawn upon him, desolate!)\\nAnd, round about his home, the glory\\nThat blushed and bloomed\\nIs but a dim-remembered story\\nOf the old time entombed.\\nVI.\\nAnd travellers now within that valley,\\nThrough the red-litten windows, see\\nVast forms that move fantastically\\nTo a discordant melody;\\nWhile, like a rapid ghastly river,\\nThrough the pale door,\\nA hideous throng rush out forever,\\nAnd laugh \\u2013 but smile no more.\\nI well remember that suggestions arising from this ballad led us into a train of thought wherein there became manifest an opinion of Usher\\u2019s which I mention not so much on account of its novelty, (for other men2 have thought thus,) as on account of the pertinacity with which he maintained it. This opinion, in its general form, was that of the sentience of all vegetable things. But, in his disordered fancy, the idea had assumed a more daring character, and trespassed, under certain conditions, upon the kingdom of inorganization. I lack words to express the full extent, or the earnest abandon of his persuasion. The belief, however, was connected (as I have previously hinted) with the gray stones of the home of his forefathers. The conditions of the sentience had been here, he imagined, fulfilled in the method of collocation of these stones \\u2013 in the order of their arrangement, as well as in that of the many fungi which overspread them, and of the decayed trees which stood around \\u2013 above all, in the long undisturbed endurance of this arrangement, and in its reduplication in the still waters of the tarn. Its evidence \\u2013 the evidence of the sentience \\u2013 was to be seen, he said, (and I here started as he spoke,) in the gradual yet certain condensation of an atmosphere of their own about the waters and the walls. The result was discoverable, he added, in that silent, yet importunate and terrible influence which for centuries had moulded the destinies of his family, and which made him what I now saw him \\u2013 what he was. Such opinions need no comment, and I will make none.\\nOur books \\u2013 the books which, for years, had formed no small portion of the mental existence of the invalid \\u2013 were, as might be supposed, in strict keeping with this character of\\u00a0phantasm. We pored together over such works as the\\u00a0Ververt et Chartreuse\\u00a0of Gresset; the\\u00a0Belphegor\\u00a0of\\u00a0Machiavelli; the Heaven and Hell of\\u00a0Swedenborg; the Subterranean Voyage of\\u00a0Nicholas Klimm\\u00a0by Holberg; the\\u00a0Chiromancy of Robert Flud, of Jean D\\u2019Indagin\\u00e9, and of De la Chambre; the Journey into the\\u00a0Blue Distance of Tieck; and the City of the Sun of\\u00a0Campanella. One favourite volume was a small octavo edition of the\\u00a0Directorium Inquisitorum, by the Dominican Eymeric de Gironne; and there were passages in Pomponius Mela, about the old African Satyrs and \\u00c6gipans, over which Usher would sit dreaming for hours. His chief delight, however, was found in the perusal of an exceedingly rare and curious book in quarto Gothic \\u2013 the manual of a forgotten church \\u2013 the Vigilae Mortuorum secundum Chorum Ecclesiae Maguntinae.\\nI could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work, and of its probable influence upon the hypochondriac, when, one evening, having informed me abruptly that the lady Madeline was no more, he stated his intention of preserving her corpse for a\\u00a0fortnight, (previously to its final interment,) in one of the numerous vaults within the main walls of the building. The worldly reason, however, assigned for this singular proceeding, was one which I did not feel at liberty to dispute. The brother had been led to his resolution (so he told me) by consideration of the unusual character of the malady of the deceased, of certain obtrusive and eager inquiries on the part of her medical men, and of the remote and exposed situation of the burial-ground of the family. I will not deny that when I called to mind the sinister countenance of the person whom I met upon the stair case, on the day of my arrival at the house, I had no desire to oppose what I regarded as at best but a harmless, and by no means an unnatural, precaution.\\nAt the request of Usher, I personally aided him in the arrangements for the temporary entombment. The body having been encoffined, we two alone bore it to its rest. The vault in which we placed it (and which had been so long unopened that our torches, half smothered in its oppressive atmosphere, gave us little opportunity for investigation) was small, damp, and entirely without means of admission for light; lying, at great depth, immediately beneath that portion of the building in which was my own sleeping apartment. It had been used, apparently, in remote feudal times, for the worst purposes of a\\u00a0donjon-keep, and, in later days, as a place of deposit for powder, or some other highly combustible substance, as a portion of its floor, and the whole interior of a long archway through which we reached it, were carefully sheathed with copper. The door, of massive iron, had been, also, similarly protected. Its immense weight caused an unusually sharp grating sound, as it moved upon its hinges.\\nHaving deposited our mournful burden upon tressels within this region of horror, we partially turned aside the yet unscrewed lid of the coffin, and looked upon the face of the tenant. A striking similitude between the brother and sister now first arrested my attention; and Usher, divining, perhaps, my thoughts, murmured out some few words from which I learned that the deceased and himself had been twins, and that sympathies of a scarcely intelligible nature had always existed between them. Our glances, however, rested not long upon the dead \\u2013 for we could not regard her unawed. The disease which had thus entombed the lady in the maturity of youth, had left, as usual in all maladies of a strictly\\u00a0cataleptical\\u00a0character, the mockery of a faint blush upon the bosom and the face, and that suspiciously lingering smile upon the lip which is so terrible in death. We replaced and screwed down the lid, and, having secured the door of iron, made our way, with toll, into the scarcely less gloomy apartments of the upper portion of the house.\\nAnd now, some days of bitter grief having elapsed, an observable change came over the features of the mental disorder of my friend. His ordinary manner had vanished. His ordinary occupations were neglected or forgotten. He roamed from chamber to chamber with hurried, unequal, and objectless step. The pallor of his countenance had assumed, if possible, a more ghastly hue \\u2013 but the luminousness of his eye had utterly gone out. The once occasional huskiness of his tone was heard no more; and a tremulous quaver, as if of extreme terror, habitually characterized his utterance. There were times, indeed, when I thought his unceasingly agitated mind was labouring with some oppressive secret, to divulge which he struggled for the necessary courage. At times, again, I was obliged to resolve all into the mere inexplicable vagaries of madness, for I beheld him gazing upon vacancy for long hours, in an attitude of the profoundest attention, as if listening to some imaginary sound. It was no wonder that his condition terrified-that it infected me. I felt creeping upon me, by slow yet certain degrees, the wild influences of his own fantastic yet impressive superstitions.\\nIt was, especially, upon retiring to bed late in the night of the seventh or eighth day after the placing of the lady Madeline within the donjon, that I experienced the full power of such feelings. Sleep came not near my couch \\u2013 while the hours waned and waned away. I struggled to reason off the nervousness which had dominion over me. I endeavoured to believe that much, if not all of what I felt, was due to the bewildering influence of the gloomy furniture of the room \\u2013 of the dark and tattered draperies, which, tortured into motion by the breath of a rising\\u00a0tempest, swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls, and rustled uneasily about the decorations of the bed. But my efforts were fruitless. An irrepressible tremour gradually pervaded my frame; and, at length, there sat upon my very heart an\\u00a0incubus\\u00a0of utterly causeless alarm. Shaking this off with a gasp and a struggle, I uplifted myself upon the pillows, and, peering earnestly within the intense darkness of the chamber, hearkened \\u2013 I know not why, except that an instinctive spirit prompted me \\u2013 to certain low and indefinite sounds which came, through the pauses of the storm, at long intervals, I knew not whence. Overpowered by an intense sentiment of horror, unaccountable yet unendurable, I threw on my clothes with haste (for I felt that I should sleep no more during the night), and endeavoured to arouse myself from the pitiable condition into which I had fallen, by pacing rapidly to and fro through the apartment.\\nI had taken but few turns in this manner, when a light step on an adjoining staircase arrested my attention. I presently recognised it as that of Usher. In an instant afterward he rapped, with a gentle touch, at my door, and entered, bearing a lamp. His countenance was, as usual,\\u00a0cadaverously\\u00a0wan \\u2013 but, moreover, there was a species of mad hilarity in his eyes \\u2013 an evidently restrained hysteria in his whole demeanour. His air appalled me \\u2013 but anything was preferable to the solitude which I had so long endured, and I even welcomed his presence as a relief.\\n\\u201cAnd you have not seen it?\\u201d he said abruptly, after having stared about him for some moments in silence \\u2013 \\u201cyou have not then seen it? \\u2013 but, stay! you shall.\\u201d Thus speaking, and having carefully shaded his lamp, he hurried to one of the casements, and threw it freely open to the storm.\\nThe impetuous fury of the entering gust nearly lifted us from our feet. It was, indeed, a\\u00a0tempestuous\\u00a0yet sternly beautiful night, and one wildly singular in its terror and its beauty. A whirlwind had apparently collected its force in our vicinity; for there were frequent and violent alterations in the direction of the wind; and the exceeding density of the clouds (which hung so low as to press upon the turrets of the house) did not prevent our perceiving the life-like velocity with which they flew careering from all points against each other, without passing away into the distance. I say that even their exceeding density did not prevent our perceiving this \\u2013 yet we had no glimpse of the moon or stars \\u2013 nor was there any flashing forth of the lightning. But the under surfaces of the huge masses of agitated vapour, as well as all terrestrial objects immediately around us, were glowing in the unnatural light of a faintly luminous and distinctly visible gaseous exhalation which hung about and enshrouded the mansion.\\n\\u201cYou must not \\u2013 you shall not behold this!\\u201d said I, shudderingly, to Usher, as I led him, with a gentle violence, from the window to a seat. \\u201cThese appearances, which bewilder you, are merely electrical phenomena not uncommon \\u2013 or it may be that they have their ghastly origin in the rank miasma of the\\u00a0tarn. Let us close this casement; \\u2013 the air is chilling and dangerous to your frame. Here is one of your favourite romances. I will read, and you shall listen; \\u2013 and so we will pass away this terrible night together.\\u201d\\nThe antique volume which I had taken up was the Mad Trist of Sir Launcelot Canning; but I had called it a favourite of Usher\\u2019s more in sad jest than in earnest; for, in truth, there is little in its uncouth and unimaginative prolixity which could have had interest for the lofty and spiritual ideality of my friend. It was, however, the only book immediately at hand; and I indulged a vague hope that the excitement which now agitated the hypochondriac, might find relief (for the history of mental disorder is full of similar anomalies) even in the extremeness of the folly which I should read. Could I have judged, indeed, by the wild over-strained air of vivacity with which he hearkened, or apparently hearkened, to the words of the tale, I might well have congratulated myself upon the success of my design.\\nI had arrived at that well-known portion of the story where Ethelred, the hero of the Trist, having sought in vain for peaceable admission into the dwelling of the hermit, proceeds to make good an entrance by force. Here, it will be remembered, the words of the narrative run thus:\\n\\u201cAnd Ethelred, who was by nature of a doughty heart, and who was now mighty withal, on account of the powerfulness of the wine which he had drunken, waited no longer to hold parley with the hermit, who,\\u00a0in sooth, was of an obstinate and maliceful turn, but, feeling the rain upon his shoulders, and fearing the rising of the\\u00a0tempest, uplifted his mace outright, and, with blows, made quickly room in the plankings of the door for his gauntleted hand; and now pulling there-with sturdily, he so cracked, and ripped, and tore all asunder, that the noise of the dry and hollow-sounding wood alarumed and reverberated throughout the forest.\\nAt the termination of this sentence I started, and for a moment, paused; for it appeared to me (although I at once concluded that my excited fancy had deceived me) \\u2013 it appeared to me that, from some very remote portion of the mansion, there came, indistinctly, to my ears, what might have been, in its exact similarity of character, the echo (but a stifled and dull one certainly) of the very cracking and ripping sound which Sir Launcelot had so particularly described. It was, beyond doubt, the coincidence alone which had arrested my attention; for, amid the rattling of the sashes of the casements, and the ordinary commingled noises of the still increasing storm, the sound, in itself, had nothing, surely, which should have interested or disturbed me. I continued the story:\\n\\u201cBut the good champion Ethelred, now entering within the door, was sore enraged and amazed to perceive no signal of the maliceful hermit; but, in the stead thereof, a dragon of a scaly and\\u00a0prodigious\\u00a0demeanour, and of a fiery tongue, which\\u00a0sate\\u00a0in guard before a palace of gold, with a floor of silver; and upon the wall there hung a shield of shining brass with this legend enwritten \\u2013\\n\\n\\n\\nWho entereth herein, a conqueror hath bin;\\nWho slayeth the dragon, the shield he shall win;\\nand Ethelred uplifted his mace, and struck upon the head of the dragon, which fell before him, and gave up his pesty breath, with a shriek so horrid and harsh, and withal so piercing, that Ethelred had fain to close his ears with his hands against the dreadful noise of it, the like whereof was never before heard.\\u201d\\nHere again I paused abruptly, and now with a feeling of wild amazement \\u2013 for there could be no doubt whatever that, in this instance, I did actually hear (although from what direction it proceeded I found it impossible to say) a low and apparently distant, but harsh, protracted, and most unusual screaming or grating sound \\u2013 the exact counterpart of what my fancy had already conjured up for the dragon\\u2019s unnatural shriek as described by the romancer.\\nOppressed, as I certainly was, upon the occurrence of the second and most extraordinary coincidence, by a thousand conflicting sensations, in which wonder and extreme terror were predominant, I still retained sufficient presence of mind to avoid exciting, by any observation, the sensitive nervousness of my companion. I was by no means certain that he had noticed the sounds in question; although, assuredly, a strange alteration had, during the last few minutes, taken place in his demeanour. From a position fronting my own, he had gradually brought round his chair, so as to sit with his face to the door of the chamber; and thus I could but partially perceive his features, although I saw that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring inaudibly. His head had dropped upon his breast \\u2013 yet I knew that he was not asleep, from the wide and rigid opening of the eye as I caught a glance of it in profile. The motion of his body, too, was at variance with this idea \\u2013 for he rocked from side to side with a gentle yet constant and uniform sway. Having rapidly taken notice of all this, I resumed the narrative of Sir Launcelot, which thus proceeded:\\n\\u201cAnd now, the champion, having escaped from the terrible fury of the dragon, bethinking himself of the brazen shield, and of the breaking up of the enchantment which was upon it, removed the carcass from out of the way before him, and approached valorously over the silver pavement of the castle to where the shield was upon the wall; which\\u00a0in sooth\\u00a0tarried not for his full coming, but fell down at his feet upon the silver floor, with a mighty great and terrible ringing sound.\\u201d\\nNo sooner had these syllables passed my lips, than \\u2013 as if a shield of brass had indeed, at the moment, fallen heavily upon a floor of silver, became aware of a distinct, hollow, metallic, and clangorous, yet apparently muffled reverberation. Completely unnerved, I leaped to my feet; but the measured rocking movement of Usher was undisturbed. I rushed to the chair in which he sat. His eyes were bent fixedly before him, and throughout his whole countenance there reigned a stony rigidity. But, as I placed my hand upon his shoulder, there came a strong shudder over his whole person; a sickly smile quivered about his lips; and I saw that he spoke in a low, hurried, and gibbering murmur, as if unconscious of my presence. Bending closely over him, I at length drank in the hideous import of his words.\\n\\u201cNot hear it? \\u2013 yes, I hear it, and have heard it. Long \\u2013 long \\u2013 long \\u2013 many minutes, many hours, many days, have I heard it \\u2013 yet I dared not \\u2013 oh, pity me, miserable wretch that I am! \\u2013 I dared not \\u2013 I dared not speak! We have put her living in the tomb! Said I not that my senses were\\u00a0acute? I now tell you that I heard her first feeble movements in the hollow coffin. I heard them \\u2013 many, many days ago \\u2013 yet I dared not \\u2013 I dared not speak! And now \\u2013 to-night \\u2013 Ethelred \\u2013 ha! ha! \\u2013 the breaking of the hermit\\u2019s door, and the death-cry of the dragon, and the clangour of the shield! \\u2013 say, rather, the rending of her coffin, and the grating of the iron hinges of her prison, and her struggles within the coppered archway of the vault! Oh whither shall I fly? Will she not be here anon? Is she not hurrying to upbraid me for my haste? Have I not heard her footstep on the stair? Do I not distinguish that heavy and horrible beating of her heart? MADMAN!\\u201d here he sprang furiously to his feet, and shrieked out his syllables, as if in the effort he were giving up his soul \\u2013 \\u201cMADMAN! I TELL YOU THAT SHE NOW STANDS WITHOUT THE DOOR!\\u201d\\nAs if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there had been found the potency of a spell \\u2013 the huge antique panels to which the speaker pointed, threw slowly back, upon the instant, ponderous and ebony jaws. It was the work of the rushing gust \\u2013 but then without those doors there DID stand the lofty and enshrouded figure of the lady Madeline of Usher. There was blood upon her white robes, and the evidence of some bitter struggle upon every portion of her emaciated frame. For a moment she remained trembling and reeling to and fro upon the threshold, then, with a low moaning cry, fell heavily inward upon the person of her brother, and in her violent and now final death-agonies, bore him to the floor a corpse, and a victim to the terrors he had anticipated.\\nFrom that chamber, and from that mansion, I fled\\u00a0aghast. The storm was still abroad in all its wrath as I found myself crossing the old causeway. Suddenly there shot along the path a wild light, and I turned to see whence a gleam so unusual could have issued; for the vast house and its shadows were alone behind me. The radiance was that of the full, setting, and blood-red moon which now shone vividly through that once barely-discernible fissure of which I have before spoken as extending from the roof of the building, in a zig-zag direction, to the base. While I gazed, this fissure rapidly widened \\u2013 there came a fierce breath of the whirlwind \\u2013 the entire orb of the satellite burst at once upon my sight \\u2013 my brain reeled as I saw the mighty walls rushing asunder \\u2013 there was a long tumultuous shouting sound like the voice of a thousand waters \\u2013 and the deep and dank\\u00a0tarn\\u00a0at my feet closed sullenly and silently over the fragments of the \\u201cHOUSE OF USHER.\\u201d\\n* * *\\nNOTES\\n1. The epigraph at the beginning of Edgar Allan Poe\\u2019s \\u201cThe Fall of the House of Usher,\\u201d taken from a poem by Pierre Jean de B\\u00e9ranger, serves as a metaphorical preface to the story\\u2019s themes and atmosphere. The lines, \\u201cSon c\\u0153ur est un luth suspendu; Sit\\u00f4t qu\\u2019on le touche il r\\u00e9sonne,\\u201d translate to \\u201cHis heart is a lute suspended; As soon as one touches it, it resonates.\\u201d\\nThis epigraph suggests a sensitivity to external influences, symbolizing the delicate and responsive nature of the human psyche. In the context of the story, it foreshadows the intense emotional and psychological states of the characters, particularly Roderick Usher, whose mental and physical condition is highly susceptible to his environment. The Usher family home, a Gothic mansion that is almost a character in its own right, acts as an external embodiment of Roderick\\u2019s internal state, with its decaying structure mirroring his deteriorating mind. The epigraph hints at the central themes of the story: the interplay between the physical and psychological, the impact of the past on the present, and the idea that both the human mind and the environments we inhabit are easily affected by stimuli, capable of producing profound reactions to seemingly minor provocations. It sets the stage for a tale where atmosphere, setting, and emotion resonate together, much like the strings of a lute respond to a touch.\\n2. Watson, Dr. Percival, Spallanzani, and especially the Bishop of Landaff.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\",\n          \"\\n \\nIn the vast realm of science fiction literature, Frank Herbert\\u2019s \\u201cDune\\u201d stands as a monumental work that goes beyond mere interstellar adventures. Beneath the surface of Arrakis\\u2019 golden dunes and political intrigue lies a profound environmental allegory that resonates with ecological themes. Let\\u2019s delve into the intricacies of Herbert\\u2019s eco-conscious masterpiece and explore how Arrakis becomes a compelling allegory for environmental challenges.\\nThe Spice Melange as a Finite Resource: At the heart of Arrakis\\u2019 environmental allegory is the spice melange, a substance that grants heightened awareness and the ability to fold space. Analogous to Earth\\u2019s limited resources, the spice serves as a metaphor for humanity\\u2019s reliance on finite commodities. Herbert ingeniously uses the spice to explore the consequences of unchecked exploitation and the ethical dilemmas surrounding resource management.\\nThe Fremen\\u2019s Water Discipline: Water, the most precious resource on Arrakis, takes center stage in the Fremen\\u2019s daily lives. Herbert mirrors our planet\\u2019s struggle with water scarcity through the Fremen\\u2019s meticulous water discipline. The stillsuits, worn by the Fremen to reclaim and recycle bodily fluids, echo our real-world need for sustainable water practices in the face of a changing climate.\\nSandworms and Ecological Balance: The colossal sandworms, guardians of the spice, symbolize the delicate ecological balance on Arrakis. Herbert prompts readers to reflect on the consequences of disrupting ecosystems, drawing parallels to Earth\\u2019s ecosystems where the extinction of a single species can have cascading effects. The sandworms, majestic and mysterious, embody the interconnectedness of life on Arrakis.\\nNoble Houses and Resource Exploitation: Arrakis becomes a microcosm of our own planet\\u2019s struggles with resource exploitation. The noble houses, eager to control the spice trade, mirror corporations and nations exploiting Earth\\u2019s resources for economic gain. Herbert\\u2019s narrative invites readers to question the ethics of resource extraction and the long-term consequences of prioritizing profit over planetary well-being.\\nHerbert\\u2019s Visionary Environmentalism: Long before environmental consciousness became a mainstream concern, Herbert was weaving a narrative that anticipated the ecological challenges of the future. \\u201cDune\\u201d serves as a cautionary tale, urging readers to consider the impact of their actions on the environment. Herbert\\u2019s visionary environmentalism remains relevant as societies grapple with climate change and the consequences of unfettered industrialization.\\nAdaptations and Contemporary Relevance: As \\u201cDune\\u201d makes its way to the big screen, filmmakers face the challenge of translating Herbert\\u2019s environmental allegory into a visual medium. Each adaptation provides an opportunity to revisit Arrakis and its ecological message, prompting audiences to reflect on the environmental challenges confronting our own world.\\nConclusion: \\u201cDune\\u201d as an Ecological Parable: In the sands of Arrakis, Frank Herbert crafted more than a science fiction epic; he created an allegory for our planet\\u2019s environmental struggles. \\u201cDune\\u201d challenges readers to confront the consequences of environmental exploitation and advocates for a mindful approach to resource management. As we navigate the intricate political landscape of Arrakis, Herbert\\u2019s environmental allegory invites us to consider the impact of our choices on Earth, making \\u201cDune\\u201d not just a classic of science fiction but a timeless reflection on our planet\\u2019s ecological destiny.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\",\n          \"\\n \\nVyvyan Holland, in his introduction to the 1966 edition of Oscar Wilde\\u2019s works, provides an insightful overview of his father\\u2019s lineage, life, and literary career. He recounts the family\\u2019s Dutch origin, Oscar\\u2019s upbringing and education, his rise in London society, and his contributions to literature, from poetry and essays to renowned plays like The Importance of Being Earnest. Holland also touches on the darker aspects of Wilde\\u2019s life, including his trial, imprisonment, and posthumous conversion to Catholicism, ultimately painting a complex and enduring portrait of one of the most celebrated figures in literary history.\\n* * *\\nINTRODUCTION TO THE 1966 EDITION\\nby Vyvyan Holland\\nOscar Wilde\\u2019s family is Dutch in origin. The first Wilde to settle in Ireland was a certain Colonel de Wilde, the son of an artist, examples of whose work hang in the Art Gallery at The Hague; he was a soldier of fortune who was granted lands in Connaught at the end of the seventeenth century for his services to King William III of England. He is said to have repented his adherence to the English king and to have become \\u2018more Irish than the Irish\\u2019. From that time the family were land agents and doctors.\\nMy father\\u2019s parents were both distinguished in their own way. Sir William Wilde was the foremost eye and ear specialist of his time, and a physician of international repute. He invented the operation for cataract and performed it on King Oscar of Sweden, for which he received the Order of the Polar Star. His mother, Lady Wilde, born Jane Francesca Elgee, was a staunch Irish Nationalist, who wrote fierce poems and articles in the Irish Nationalist newspaper The Nation, under the name of \\u2018Speranza\\u2019, a name she had adopted from her motto \\u2018Fidanza, Constanza, Speranza\\u2019 \\u2013 Faith, Constancy, Hope. Lady Wilde had three children, William, Oscar and Isola, who died when she was ten, to Oscar\\u2019s lasting grief. Oscar Wilde was born on 16 October 1854, and was given the names Oscar Fingal O\\u2019Flahertie Wills Wilde.\\nHis education began at Portora Royal School In Enniskillen, from which he obtained a scholarship to Trinity College, Dublin, where he won the Berkeley Gold Medal for Greek. From there he received a demyship to Magdalen College, Oxford. While at Oxford he came under the Influence of John Ruskin and Walter Pater. Pater preached the love of Art for Art\\u2019s sake, and Oscar Wilde, going one step further, set out to idolise beauty for beauty\\u2019s sake and filled his rooms looking over the Cherwell with blue china and reproductions of paintings by Rossetti and Burne-Jones. Aestheticism was the key-note of his creed and he declared that beauty was the ideal after which everyone should strive.\\nMy father\\u2019s life at Oxford, one gathers from his letters, was a joyous one. He entered whole-heartedly into the undergraduate life of the University and distinguished himself by winning the Newdigate Prize for English verse and getting a double first in Classics. Upon this note he came to London in 1879 with the remains of a small patrimony and started to make his living by his pen. True to his doctrine of beauty he established himself as the \\u2018Apostle of Aestheticism\\u2019 and drew attention to himself by the eccentricity of his dress. It must be remembered that at this period the clothing of the British upper middle classes was rigidly conventional, and the sight of him in the evening in a velvet coat edged with braid, knee-breeches, black silk stockings, a soft loose shirt with a wide turn-down collar and a large flowing tie, was bound to arouse indignant curiosity.\\nAt the same time he was writing poems, and in 1880 he also wrote Vera, a rather immature play, which ran for one week in New York in 1883 and never reached the boards in London. In 1881 his collected poems were published, and in 1882, being short of money, he was persuaded to go on a lecture tour to America. This proved to be a brilliant success and he returned to England in 1883, covered, if not with glory, at least with considerable notoriety.\\nOn his return to Europe, he retired to Paris to finish another play, The Duchess of Padua, for the American actress Mary Anderson; but when she received the play, she turned it down flatly. This was really a disaster for Oscar Wilde, and he returned to England and went on a series of lecture tours in the provinces. However, this nomadic life soon palled and he returned to London where, in 1884, he married Constance Mary, daughter of a distinguished Irish barrister, Horace Lloyd, Q.C. Oscar was romantically in love with his beautiful young wife and for some years he was ideally happy. He had two sons by his wife \\u2013 Cyril, born in 1885, and myself in 1886.\\nOddly enough, although his literary activities had been almost entirely confined to writing poetry until his marriage, he now turned largely to prose and, with the exception of The Sphinx, the idea of which had occurred to him much earlier, he wrote few poems until after his imprisonment, when he wrote The Ballad of Reading Gaol. Boris Brasol, who wrote one of the only two carefully considered lives of my father, sums up his poetic period as follows:\\n\\u2018He began his literary career as a composer of sonorous and pleasing verses in which, however, as he himself admitted, \\u2018there was more rhyme than reason\\u2019; yet as he grew older, he seemed to have lost all taste for poetry, and though there Is nothing that would justify the contention that he ever regarded his early poems as callow productions, the fact remains that upon reaching maturity he took no further interest in that delightful occupation which Browning aptly called \\u201cthe unlocking of hearts with sonnet keys\\u201d.\\u2019\\nUpon what, then, does his reputation as an author rest? His early poems were mostly lyrical, and certain of them will undoubtedly pass the test of time. His true literary life was spread over seven years only, from 1888 until 1894. In 1887 he had become editor of Woman\\u2019s World in which capacity he continued until 1889 when he resigned. He had gathered a reputation for eccentricity and, still more, as a conversationalist. There are few people alive now who remember his conversation, but when in 1954 a plaque was unveiled by Sir Compton Mackenzie on the house in Tite Street where my family lived for eleven years, he read the following message from Sir Max Beerbohm (the Incomparable Max!), who felt too frail to undertake the journey to London to be present:\\n\\u2018I have had the privilege of listening to many masters of table talk \\u2013 Meredith and Swinburne, Edmund Gosse and Henry James, Augustine Birrell and Arthur Balfour, Gilbert Chesterton and Desmond MacCarthy and Hilaire Belloc \\u2013 all of them splendid in their own way. But Oscar was the greatest of them all \\u2013 the most spontaneous and yet the most polished, the most soothing and yet the most surprising\\u2026Nobody was willing to interrupt the music of so magnificent a virtuoso. To have heard him consoled me for not having heard Dr Johnson or Edmund Burke, Lord Brougham or Sidney Smith.\\u2019\\nWinston Churchill was once asked whom he would like to meet and talk with in after life, and he replied, without hesitation: \\u2018Oscar Wilde.\\u2019\\nWilde\\u2019s first memorable work was The Happy Prince, which appeared in 1888. The stories in The Happy Prince are really poems in prose more than fairytales for children; and yet the remarkable thing is that they appeal equally to children and adults.\\nIn 1891 he produced a small volume ot tour stories which he had written some time previously. The book was called Lord Arthur Savile\\u2019s Crime and Other Stories, the other three tales being The Canterville Ghost\\u2019, The Sphinx without a Secret\\u2019 and \\u2018The Model Millionaire\\u2019. The first two of these stories have been dramatised and their substance has been copied on several occasions; they possess the light-hearted gaiety and insouciance that find their fullest expression in The Importance of Being Earnest, and show the buoyancy of my father\\u2019s spirit at that time.\\nA House of Pomegranates, my father\\u2019s other book of short stories \\u2013 one can hardly call them fairy tales \\u2013 appeared with illustrations by Charles Shannon, R.A. in the same year. This book completely puzzled the critics, who thought that the stories were meant for children and protested, quite rightly, that no child could understand them. This was followed by The Sphinx, which really dated from his Oxford days, and upon which he had worked at intervals ever since. The critics were again confused by the poem, which was really nothing more than an experiment with words. He revelled in finding rhymes for words such as hieroglyph and catafalque, which he rhymed with hippogriff and Amenalk.\\nIn 1891, too, Oscar Wilde\\u2019s only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, appeared in book form, enlarged from the original which had been already published in Lippincott\\u2019s Magazine. The publication of this work was greeted with a storm of protest by the critics. The English Press was almost unanimous in its condemnation of the book. The Idea of the book had first come to my father some years before. Hesketh Pearson tells the story of it in his Life of Oscar Wilde;\\u2019 In the year 1884 Wilde used to drop in at the studio of a painter, Basil Ward, one of whose sitters was a young man of exceptional beauty\\u2026When the portrait was done and the youth had gone, Wilde happened to say, \\u201cWhat a pity that such a glorious creature should ever grow old!\\u201d The artist agreed, adding, \\u201cHow delightful it would be if he could remain exactly as he is, while the portrait aged and withered in his stead!\\u201d Wilde expressed his obligation by calling the painter in his story Basil Hallward.\\u2019\\nBy far the most interesting and entertaining book of essays that Oscar Wilde wrote was Intentions, in which he really gave rein to his imagination. In my own opinion, it is the most absorbing of all his works. The Critic as Artist occupies considerably more than half of it; its sub-title \\u2018with some remarks upon the importance of doing nothing\\u2019 shows the curious charm the word \\u2018importance\\u2019 had for him; it occurs in the titles of two of his plays, and is constantly cropping up in his essays. It is almost as though the word held a strange sonorousness for him and that he liked to roll it, if not round his tongue, then round his mind.\\nBut the most interesting essay in the book is The Decay of Lying. The essay is in the form of a dialogue, the dominant theme being the vast superiority of Art over Nature, leading to the conclusion that Nature follows Art.\\nOscar Wilde now entered into his final stage, the one for which he was destined, that of a dramatist. In 1891 he wrote Lady Windermere\\u2019s Fan, which he described as \\u2018one of those modern drawing-room plays with pink lampshades\\u2019. It was produced at the St James\\u2019s Theatre in February, 1892 by George Alexander. There were loud cries of \\u2018Author!\\u2019 at the end of the play and Wilde came onto the stage with a cigarette in his gloved hand and said: \\u2018Ladies and Gentlemen. I have enjoyed this evening immensely. The actors have given us a charming rendering of a delightful play, and your appreciation has been most intelligent. I congratulate you on the great success of your performance which persuades me that you think almost as highly of the play as I do.\\u2019\\nWhen Wilde had finished Lady Windermere\\u2019s Fan he retired to Paris and wrote his Biblical play Salome in French, dedicated to Pierre Louys who made certain corrections in the French, but did not otherwise interfere with it. Sarah Bernhardt was immensely attracted to this play, and she put it into rehearsal at the Palace Theatre in London, with herself in the title-role. However, the Lord Chamberlain refused to grant it a licence, on the ground that no play which contained Biblical characters was allowed to be performed on the English stage. This so annoyed Wilde that he announced his intentions of renouncing his British nationality and becoming a Frenchman, there being no such restrictions in France. As matters turned out, it is a pity that he did not carry out his threat.\\nIn the summer of 1892 he wrote A Woman of No Importance, which was produced with immediate success by Herbert Beerbohm Tree at the Haymarket in 1893. Once again the audience rose to its feet and called for the author. This time remembering the bad impression he had made on the first night of Lady Windermere\\u2019s Fan, he got up in the box in which he was sitting and announced: \\u2018Ladies and Gentlemen, I regret to inform you that Mr Oscar Wilde is not in the house.\\u2019\\nOn 3 January 1895, Oscar Wilde\\u2019s third important play An Ideal Husband was produced by Lewis Waller. The Prince of Wales was present at the first night. It was almost unprecedented for Royalty to be present at a first night, and it seemed now that Wilde\\u2019s future was assured. George Bernard Shaw\\u2019s comment on the play is worth repeating: \\u2018Mr Oscar Wilde\\u2019s new play at the Haymarket is a dangerous subject, because he has the property of making his critics dull\\u2026He plays with everything; with wit, with philosophy, with drama, with actors and audience, with the whole theatre.\\u2019\\nAnd so we come to Oscar Wilde\\u2019s last, and his most brilliant play, The Importance of Being Earnest. Wilde originally wrote the play in four acts, as he had written his other three major plays. He submitted it in this form to George Alexander who, with the object of making room for a \\u2018curtain raiser\\u2019, as was usual in those days, asked Wilde to cut it to three acts. When, four years later, Leonard Smithers published the play in book form, it was this three-act version that he had printed, and each subsequent edition has followed this pattern. Why this has been so is not clear, but the play as written by Oscar Wilde, with two extra characters in it, is the play as given in this volume. As Mr Philip Drake, who is responsible for this edition of Wilde\\u2019s works, remarked, it seems a pity that George Alexander should have a permanent influence on the play.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Importance of Being Earnestwas produced at the St James\\u2019s Theatre on 14 February 1895. Wilde had now reached the pinnacle of his success. Two plays of his were drawing crowded audiences in the West End, and actormanagers were falling over one another to beg him to write for them. Then the Marquess of Queensberry, with the object of attacking his son, Lord Alfred Douglas, because of his friendship with Wilde, launched a campaign of ungovernable fury on Wilde. The story has been told often enough; Alfred Douglas, whose only object was to see his father in the dock, persuaded Oscar Wilde to bring a prosecution for criminal libel against him. Lord Queensberry was triumphantly acquitted and his place in the dock was taken by Oscar Wilde, who was sentenced to two years imprisonment.\\nWhile in prison, Wilde wrote the letter to Lord Alfred Douglas, part of which was published in 1905 by Robert Ross, under the title of De Profundis. In a letter to Robert Ross he wrote: \\u2018This is indeed an Encyclical letter, and as the Bulls of the Holy Father are named from their opening words, it may be spoken of as Epistola: in Carcere el Vinculis.\\u2019 The manuscript was not revised by Wilde, although he intended to do this, as is shown by the letter he wrote to Robert Ross: \\u2018As soon as you have read it, I want you to have it copied for me. As regards the method of copying, I wish the copy to be done on good paper and a wide rubricated margin should be left for corrections.\\u2019 A copy of De Profundis was made and sent to Alfred Douglas; but after reading the first few pages, he destroyed it, probably thinking, rather naively, that there was no other copy in existence. Douglas strenuously denied ever having received the letter, and he could not go back on this without contradicting himself.\\nAfter my father\\u2019s death in 1900, Alfred Douglas tried to get hold of the manuscript, but Robert Ross settled the matter by sealing it up and presenting it to the British Museum, with the proviso that it should remain sealed for sixty years, that is to say until 1960, at the end of which time it might safely be presumed that everyone mentioned in it would be dead.\\nThe copying was done hastily and without much care, because the version printed in 1949 varied in several particulars from the original manuscript, although, of course, the substance was the same. The version here printed has been carefully compared with the original and is exactly as Wilde wrote it.\\nThe Portrait of Mr. W. H. was first published as an article of 12,000 words in Blackwood\\u2019s Magazine for July, 1889. Oscar Wilde became more and more obsessed with the idea contained in the article and during the next four years he re-wrote the story and added to it, bringing the total up to 25,000 words. The manuscript disappeared at the time of the sale of my father\\u2019s effects at Tite Street, together with others, and did not re-appear until the year 1920 in America, where it was published in a limited edition by Mitchell Kennerley. The expanded version is printed in this edition.\\nThe only work that my father wrote after 1897 was the poem The Ballad of Reading Gaol, which he wrote at Berneval, so that Douglas\\u2019s claim to have had a large share in writing it may be ignored, as he and Wilde did not meet again until later.\\nAll his life, my father had an intense leaning towards religious mysticism and was strongly attracted to the Catholic Church, into which he was received on his death bed in 1900. His remains now lie in the French National Cemetery of Pere Lachaise.\\nSOURCE: Complete Works of Oscar Wilde, with an introduction by Vyvyan Holland, Collins, 1966\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"full_name\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"EDGAR \",\n          \"VYVYAN HOLLAND\",\n          \"HENRY DAVID\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Roderick\\u2019s twin sister, Madeline, is gravely ill with a mysterious condition that leaves her cataleptic. The narrative unfolds in a gloomy atmosphere, filled with foreboding and supernatural elements, as the narrator witnesses the psychological disintegration of Roderick and the bizarre events leading up to Madeline\\u2019s death and terrifying return from the grave. The story culminates in the literal and metaphorical collapse of the Usher house into the dark tarn that mirrors it, symbolizing the end of the Usher family line and the inescapable doom of their ancient curse. Poe masterfully weaves themes of fear, isolation, and madness, creating a quintessential Gothic tale that explores the depths of human despair and the fragility of the psyche.\\n* * *\\nby Edgar Allan Poe\\nSon c\\u0153ur est un luth suspendu;\\nSit\\u00f4t qu\\u2019on le touche il r\\u00e9sonne.\\n\\u2014De B\\u00e9ranger.1\\nDuring the whole of a dull, dark, and soundless day in the autumn of the year, when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens, I had been passing alone, on horseback, through a singularly dreary tract of country; and at length found myself, as the shades of the evening drew on, within view of the melancholy House of Usher. I know not how it was \\u2013 but, with the first glimpse of the building, a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit. I say insufferable; for the feeling was unrelieved by any of that half-pleasurable, because poetic, sentiment, with which the mind usually receives even the sternest natural images of the desolate or terrible. I looked upon the scene before me \\u2013 upon the mere house, and the simple landscape features of the domain \\u2013 upon the bleak walls \\u2013 upon the vacant eye-like windows \\u2013 upon a few rank sedges \\u2013 and upon a few white trunks of decayed trees \\u2013 with an utter depression of soul which I can compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the after-dream of the reveller upon opium \\u2013 the bitter lapse into everyday life \\u2013 the hideous dropping off of the veil. There was an iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the heart \\u2013 an unredeemed dreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could torture into aught of the sublime. What was it \\u2013 I paused to think \\u2013 what was it that so unnerved me in the contemplation of the House of Usher? It was a mystery all insoluble; nor could I grapple with the shadowy fancies that crowded upon me as I pondered. I was forced to fall back upon the unsatisfactory conclusion, that while, beyond doubt, there are combinations of very simple natural objects which have the power of thus affecting us, still the analysis of this power lies among considerations beyond our depth. It was possible, I reflected, that a mere different arrangement of the particulars of the scene, of the details of the picture, would be sufficient to modify, or perhaps to annihilate its capacity for sorrowful impression; and, acting upon this idea, I reined my horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in unruffled lustre by the dwelling, and gazed down \\u2013 but with a shudder even more thrilling than before \\u2013 upon the remodelled and inverted images of the gray sedge, and the ghastly tree-stems, and the vacant and eye-like windows.\\nNevertheless, in this mansion of gloom I now proposed to myself a\\u00a0sojourn\\u00a0of some weeks. Its proprietor, Roderick Usher, had been one of my boon companions in boyhood; but many years had elapsed since our last meeting. A letter, however, had lately reached me in a distant part of the country \\u2013 a letter from him \\u2013 which, in its wildly importunate nature, had admitted of no other than a personal reply. The MS. gave evidence of nervous agitation. The writer spoke of\\u00a0acute\\u00a0bodily illness \\u2013 of a mental disorder which oppressed him \\u2013 and of an earnest desire to see me, as his best, and indeed his only personal friend, with a view of attempting, by the cheerfulness of my society, some alleviation of his malady. It was the manner in which all this, and much more, was said \\u2013 it the apparent heart that went with his request \\u2013 which allowed me no room for hesitation; and I accordingly obeyed forthwith what I still considered a very singular summons.\\nAlthough, as boys, we had been even intimate associates, yet I really knew little of my friend. His reserve had been always excessive and habitual. I was aware, however, that his very ancient family had been noted, time out of mind, for a peculiar sensibility of temperament, displaying itself, through long ages, in many works of exalted art, and manifested, of late, in repeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive charity, as well as in a passionate devotion to the intricacies, perhaps even more than to the orthodox and easily recognisable beauties, of musical science. I had learned, too, the very remarkable fact, that the stem of the Usher race, all time-honoured as it was, had put forth, at no period, any enduring branch; in other words, that the entire family lay in the direct line of descent, and had always, with very trifling and very temporary variation, so lain. It was this deficiency, I considered, while running over in thought the perfect keeping of the character of the premises with the accredited character of the people, and while speculating upon the possible influence which the one, in the long lapse of centuries, might have exercised upon the other \\u2013 it was this deficiency, perhaps, of collateral issue, and the consequent undeviating transmission, from sire to son, of the patrimony with the name, which had, at length, so identified the two as to merge the original title of the estate in the quaint and\\u00a0equivocal\\u00a0appellation of the \\u201cHouse of Usher\\u201d \\u2013 an appellation which seemed to include, in the minds of the peasantry who used it, both the family and the family mansion.\\nI have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish experiment \\u2013 that of looking down within the\\u00a0tarn \\u2013 had been to deepen the first singular impression. There can be no doubt that the consciousness of the rapid increase of my superstition \\u2013 for why should I not so term it? \\u2013 served mainly to accelerate the increase itself. Such, I have long known, is the\\u00a0paradoxical\\u00a0law of all sentiments having terror as a basis. And it might have been for this reason only, that, when I again uplifted my eyes to the house itself, from its image in the pool, there grew in my mind a strange fancy \\u2013 a fancy so ridiculous, indeed, that I but mention it to show the vivid force of the sensations which oppressed me. I had so worked upon my imagination as really to believe that about the whole mansion and domain there hung an atmosphere peculiar to themselves and their immediate vicinity-an atmosphere which had no affinity with the air of heaven, but which had reeked up from the decayed trees, and the gray wall, and the silent\\u00a0tarn \\u2013 a pestilent and mystic vapour, dull, sluggish, faintly discernible, and leaden-hued.\\nShaking off from my spirit what must have been a dream, I scanned more narrowly the real aspect of the building. Its principal feature seemed to be that of an excessive antiquity. The discoloration of ages had been great. Minute fungi overspread the whole exterior, hanging in a fine tangled web-work from the eaves. Yet all this was apart from any extraordinary dilapidation. No portion of the masonry had fallen; and there appeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfect adaptation of parts, and the crumbling condition of the individual stones. In this there was much that reminded me of the specious totality of old wood-work which has rotted for long years in some neglected vault, with no disturbance from the breath of the external air. Beyond this indication of extensive decay, however, the fabric gave little token of instability. Perhaps the eye of a scrutinising observer might have discovered a barely perceptible fissure, which, extending from the roof of the building in front, made its way down the wall in a zigzag direction, until it became lost in the\\u00a0sullen\\u00a0waters of the\\u00a0tarn.\\nNoticing these things, I rode over a short causeway to the house. A servant in waiting took my horse, and I entered the Gothic archway of the hall. A valet, of stealthy step, thence conducted me, in silence, through many dark and intricate passages in my progress to the studio of his master. Much that I encountered on the way contributed, I know not how, to heighten the vague sentiments of which I have already spoken. While the objects around me \\u2013 while the carvings of the ceilings, the sombre tapestries of the walls, the ebon blackness of the floors, and the\\u00a0phantasmagoric\\u00a0armorial trophies which rattled as I strode, were but matters to which, or to such as which, I had been accustomed from my infancy \\u2013 while I hesitated not to acknowledge how familiar was all this \\u2013 I still wondered to find how unfamiliar were the fancies which ordinary images were stirring up. On one of the staircases, I met the physician of the family. His countenance, I thought, wore a mingled expression of low cunning and perplexity. He accosted me with\\u00a0trepidation\\u00a0and passed on. The valet now threw open a door and ushered me into the presence of his master.\\nThe room in which I found myself was very large and lofty. The windows were long, narrow, and pointed, and at so vast a distance from the black oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible from within. Feeble gleams of encrimsoned light made their way through the trellised panes, and served to render sufficiently distinct the more prominent objects around; the eye, however, struggled in vain to reach the remoter angles of the chamber, or the recesses of the vaulted and fretted ceiling. Dark draperies hung upon the walls. The general furniture was profuse, comfortless, antique, and tattered. Many books and musical instruments lay scattered about, but failed to give any vitality to the scene. I felt that I breathed an atmosphere of sorrow. An air of stern, deep, and irredeemable gloom hung over and pervaded all.\\nUpon my entrance, Usher arose from a sofa on which he had been lying at full length, and greeted me with a vivacious warmth which had much in it, I at first thought, of an overdone cordiality \\u2013 of the constrained effort of the ennuy\\u00e9 man of the world. A glance, however, at his countenance, convinced me of his perfect sincerity. We sat down; and for some moments, while he spoke not, I gazed upon him with a feeling half of pity, half of awe. Surely, man had never before so terribly altered, in so brief a period, as had Roderick Usher! It was with difficulty that I could bring myself to admit the identity of the wan being before me with the companion of my early boyhood. Yet the character of his face had been at all times remarkable. A cadaverousness of complexion; an eye large, liquid, and luminous beyond comparison; lips somewhat thin and very pallid, but of a surpassingly beautiful curve; a nose of a delicate Hebrew model, but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations; a finely moulded chin, speaking, in its want of prominence, of a want of moral energy; hair of a more than web-like softness and tenuity; these features, with an inordinate expansion above the regions of the temple, made up altogether a countenance not easily to be forgotten. And now in the mere exaggeration of the prevailing character of these features, and of the expression they were wont to convey, lay so much of change that I doubted to whom I spoke. The now ghastly pallor of the skin, and the now miraculous lustre of the eve, above all things startled and even awed me. The silken hair, too, had been suffered to grow all unheeded, and as, in its wild gossamer texture, it floated rather than fell about the face, I could not, even with effort, connect its Arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity.\\nIn the manner of my friend I was at once struck with an incoherence \\u2013 an inconsistency; and I soon found this to arise from a series of feeble and futile struggles to overcome an habitual trepidancy \\u2013 an excessive nervous agitation. For something of this nature I had indeed been prepared, no less by his letter, than by reminiscences of certain boyish traits, and by conclusions deduced from his peculiar physical conformation and temperament. His action was alternately vivacious and\\u00a0sullen. His voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision (when the animal spirits seemed utterly in\\u00a0abeyance) to that species of energetic concision \\u2013 that abrupt, weighty, unhurried, and hollow-sounding enunciation \\u2013 that leaden, self-balanced and perfectly modulated guttural utterance, which may be observed in the lost drunkard, or the irreclaimable eater of opium, during the periods of his most intense excitement.\\nIt was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit, of his earnest desire to see me, and of the solace he expected me to afford him. He entered, at some length, into what he conceived to be the nature of his malady. It was, he said, a constitutional and a family evil, and one for which he despaired to find a remedy \\u2013 a mere nervous affection, he immediately added, which would undoubtedly soon pass off. It displayed itself in a host of unnatural sensations. Some of these, as he detailed them, interested and bewildered me; although, perhaps, the terms, and the general manner of the narration had their weight. He suffered much from a morbid acuteness of the senses; the most insipid food was alone endurable; he could wear only garments of certain texture; the odours of all flowers were oppressive; his eyes were tortured by even a faint light; and there were but peculiar sounds, and these from stringed instruments, which did not inspire him with horror.\\nTo an\\u00a0anomalous\\u00a0species of terror I found him a bounden slave. \\u201cI shall perish,\\u201d said he, \\u201cI must perish in this deplorable folly. Thus, thus, and not otherwise, shall I be lost. I dread the events of the future, not in themselves, but in their results. I shudder at the thought of any, even the most trivial, incident, which may operate upon this intolerable agitation of soul. I have, indeed, no abhorrence of danger, except in its absolute effect \\u2013 in terror. In this unnerved-in this pitiable condition \\u2013 I feel that the period will sooner or later arrive when I must abandon life and reason together, in some struggle with the grim\\u00a0phantasm, FEAR.\\u201d\\nI learned, moreover, at intervals, and through broken and\\u00a0equivocal\\u00a0hints, another singular feature of his mental condition. He was enchained by certain superstitious impressions in regard to the dwelling which he tenanted, and whence, for many years, he had never ventured forth \\u2013 in regard to an influence whose supposititious force was conveyed in terms too shadowy here to be re-stated \\u2013 an influence which some peculiarities in the mere form and substance of his family mansion, had, by\\u00a0dint\\u00a0of long sufferance, he said, obtained over his spirit-an effect which the physique of the gray walls and turrets, and of the dim\\u00a0tarn\\u00a0into which they all looked down, had, at length, brought about upon the morale of his existence.\\nHe admitted, however, although with hesitation, that much of the peculiar gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a more natural and far more\\u00a0palpable\\u00a0origin \\u2013 to the severe and long-continued illness \\u2013 indeed to the evidently approaching dissolution-of a tenderly beloved sister \\u2013 his sole companion for long years \\u2013 his last and only relative on earth. \\u201cHer decease,\\u201d he said, with a bitterness which I can never forget, \\u201cwould leave him (him the hopeless and the frail) the last of the ancient race of the Ushers.\\u201d While he spoke, the lady Madeline (for so was she called) passed slowly through a remote portion of the apartment, and, without having noticed my presence, disappeared. I regarded her with an utter astonishment not unmingled with dread \\u2013 and yet I found it impossible to account for such feelings. A sensation of stupor oppressed me, as my eyes followed her retreating steps. When a door, at length, closed upon her, my glance sought instinctively and eagerly the countenance of the brother \\u2013 but he had buried his face in his hands, and I could only perceive that a far more than ordinary wanness had overspread the emaciated fingers through which trickled many passionate tears.\\nThe disease of the lady Madeline had long baffled the skill of her physicians. A settled apathy, a gradual wasting away of the person, and frequent although transient affections of a partially\\u00a0cataleptical\\u00a0character, were the unusual diagnosis. Hitherto she had steadily borne up against the pressure of her malady, and had not betaken herself finally to bed; but, on the closing in of the evening of my arrival at the house, she succumbed (as her brother told me at night with inexpressible agitation) to the prostrating power of the destroyer; and I learned that the glimpse I had obtained of her person would thus probably be the last I should obtain \\u2013 that the lady, at least while living, would be seen by me no more.\\nFor several days ensuing, her name was unmentioned by either Usher or myself: and during this period I was busied in earnest endeavours to alleviate the melancholy of my friend. We painted and read together; or I listened, as if in a dream, to the wild improvisations of his speaking guitar. And thus, as a closer and still intimacy admitted me more unreservedly into the recesses of his spirit, the more bitterly did I perceive the futility of all attempt at cheering a mind from which darkness, as if an inherent positive quality, poured forth upon all objects of the moral and physical universe, in one unceasing radiation of gloom.\\nI shall ever bear about me a memory of the many solemn hours I thus spent alone with the master of the House of Usher. Yet I should fail in any attempt to convey an idea of the exact character of the studies, or of the occupations, in which he involved me, or led me the way. An excited and highly distempered ideality threw a\\u00a0sulphureous\\u00a0lustre over all. His long improvised dirges will ring forever in my ears. Among other things, I hold painfully in mind a certain singular perversion and amplification of the wild air of the last waltz of Von Weber. From the paintings over which his elaborate fancy brooded, and which grew, touch by touch, into vaguenesses at which I shuddered the more thrillingly, because I shuddered knowing not why; \\u2013 from these paintings (vivid as their images now are before me) I would in vain endeavour to educe more than a small portion which should lie within the compass of merely written words. By the utter simplicity, by the nakedness of his designs, he arrested and overawed attention. If ever mortal painted an idea, that mortal was Roderick Usher. For me at least \\u2013 in the circumstances then surrounding me \\u2013 there arose out of the pure abstractions which the hypochondriac contrived to throw upon his canvas, an intensity of intolerable awe, no shadow of which felt I ever yet in the contemplation of the certainly glowing yet too concrete reveries of\\u00a0Fuseli.\\nOne of the\\u00a0phantasmagoric\\u00a0conceptions of my friend, partaking not so rigidly of the spirit of abstraction, may be shadowed forth, although feebly, in words. A small picture presented the interior of an immensely long and rectangular vault or tunnel, with low walls, smooth, white, and without interruption or device. Certain accessory points of the design served well to convey the idea that this excavation lay at an exceeding depth below the surface of the earth. No outlet was observed in any portion of its vast extent, and no torch, or other artificial source of light was discernible; yet a flood of intense rays rolled throughout, and bathed the whole in a ghastly and inappropriate splendour.\\nI have just spoken of that morbid condition of the auditory nerve which rendered all music intolerable to the sufferer, with the exception of certain effects of stringed instruments. It was, perhaps, the narrow limits to which he thus confined himself upon the guitar, which gave birth, in great measure, to the fantastic character of his performances. But the fervid facility of his impromptus could not be so accounted for. They must have been, and were, in the notes, as well as in the words of his wild fantasias (for he not unfrequently accompanied himself with rhymed verbal improvisations), the result of that intense mental collectedness and concentration to which I have previously alluded as observable only in particular moments of the highest artificial excitement. The words of one of these rhapsodies I have easily remembered. I was, perhaps, the more forcibly impressed with it, as he gave it, because, in the under or mystic current of its meaning, I fancied that I perceived, and for the first time, a full consciousness on the part of Usher, of the tottering of his lofty reason upon her throne. The verses, which were entitled \\u201cThe Haunted Palace,\\u201d ran very nearly, if not accurately, thus:\\nI.\\nIn the greenest of our valleys,\\nBy good angels tenanted,\\nOnce fair and stately palace \\u2013\\nRadiant palace \\u2013 reared its head.\\nIn the monarch Thought\\u2019s dominion \\u2013\\nIt stood there!\\nNever seraph spread a pinion\\nOver fabric half so fair.\\nII.\\n\\n\\n\\nBanners yellow, glorious, golden,\\nOn its roof did float and flow;\\n(This \\u2013 all this \\u2013 was in the olden\\nTime long ago)\\nAnd every gentle air that dallied,\\nIn that sweet day,\\nAlong the ramparts plumed and\\u00a0pallid,\\nA winged odour went away.\\nIII.\\nWanderers in that happy valley\\nThrough two luminous windows saw\\nSpirits moving musically\\nTo a lute\\u2019s well-tuned law,\\nRound about a throne, where sitting\\n(Porphyrogene!)\\nIn state his glory well befitting,\\nThe ruler of the realm was seen.\\nIV.\\nAnd all with pearl and ruby glowing\\nWas the fair palace door,\\nThrough which came flowing, flowing, flowing\\nAnd sparkling evermore,\\nA troop of Echoes whose sweet duty\\nWas but to sing,\\nIn voices of surpassing beauty,\\nThe wit and wisdom of their king.\\nV.\\nBut evil things, in robes of sorrow,\\nAssailed the monarch\\u2019s high estate;\\n(Ah, let us mourn, for never morrow\\nShall dawn upon him, desolate!)\\nAnd, round about his home, the glory\\nThat blushed and bloomed\\nIs but a dim-remembered story\\nOf the old time entombed.\\nVI.\\nAnd travellers now within that valley,\\nThrough the red-litten windows, see\\nVast forms that move fantastically\\nTo a discordant melody;\\nWhile, like a rapid ghastly river,\\nThrough the pale door,\\nA hideous throng rush out forever,\\nAnd laugh \\u2013 but smile no more.\\nI well remember that suggestions arising from this ballad led us into a train of thought wherein there became manifest an opinion of Usher\\u2019s which I mention not so much on account of its novelty, (for other men2 have thought thus,) as on account of the pertinacity with which he maintained it. This opinion, in its general form, was that of the sentience of all vegetable things. But, in his disordered fancy, the idea had assumed a more daring character, and trespassed, under certain conditions, upon the kingdom of inorganization. I lack words to express the full extent, or the earnest abandon of his persuasion. The belief, however, was connected (as I have previously hinted) with the gray stones of the home of his forefathers. The conditions of the sentience had been here, he imagined, fulfilled in the method of collocation of these stones \\u2013 in the order of their arrangement, as well as in that of the many fungi which overspread them, and of the decayed trees which stood around \\u2013 above all, in the long undisturbed endurance of this arrangement, and in its reduplication in the still waters of the tarn. Its evidence \\u2013 the evidence of the sentience \\u2013 was to be seen, he said, (and I here started as he spoke,) in the gradual yet certain condensation of an atmosphere of their own about the waters and the walls. The result was discoverable, he added, in that silent, yet importunate and terrible influence which for centuries had moulded the destinies of his family, and which made him what I now saw him \\u2013 what he was. Such opinions need no comment, and I will make none.\\nOur books \\u2013 the books which, for years, had formed no small portion of the mental existence of the invalid \\u2013 were, as might be supposed, in strict keeping with this character of\\u00a0phantasm. We pored together over such works as the\\u00a0Ververt et Chartreuse\\u00a0of Gresset; the\\u00a0Belphegor\\u00a0of\\u00a0Machiavelli; the Heaven and Hell of\\u00a0Swedenborg; the Subterranean Voyage of\\u00a0Nicholas Klimm\\u00a0by Holberg; the\\u00a0Chiromancy of Robert Flud, of Jean D\\u2019Indagin\\u00e9, and of De la Chambre; the Journey into the\\u00a0Blue Distance of Tieck; and the City of the Sun of\\u00a0Campanella. One favourite volume was a small octavo edition of the\\u00a0Directorium Inquisitorum, by the Dominican Eymeric de Gironne; and there were passages in Pomponius Mela, about the old African Satyrs and \\u00c6gipans, over which Usher would sit dreaming for hours. His chief delight, however, was found in the perusal of an exceedingly rare and curious book in quarto Gothic \\u2013 the manual of a forgotten church \\u2013 the Vigilae Mortuorum secundum Chorum Ecclesiae Maguntinae.\\nI could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work, and of its probable influence upon the hypochondriac, when, one evening, having informed me abruptly that the lady Madeline was no more, he stated his intention of preserving her corpse for a\\u00a0fortnight, (previously to its final interment,) in one of the numerous vaults within the main walls of the building. The worldly reason, however, assigned for this singular proceeding, was one which I did not feel at liberty to dispute. The brother had been led to his resolution (so he told me) by consideration of the unusual character of the malady of the deceased, of certain obtrusive and eager inquiries on the part of her medical men, and of the remote and exposed situation of the burial-ground of the family. I will not deny that when I called to mind the sinister countenance of the person whom I met upon the stair case, on the day of my arrival at the house, I had no desire to oppose what I regarded as at best but a harmless, and by no means an unnatural, precaution.\\nAt the request of Usher, I personally aided him in the arrangements for the temporary entombment. The body having been encoffined, we two alone bore it to its rest. The vault in which we placed it (and which had been so long unopened that our torches, half smothered in its oppressive atmosphere, gave us little opportunity for investigation) was small, damp, and entirely without means of admission for light; lying, at great depth, immediately beneath that portion of the building in which was my own sleeping apartment. It had been used, apparently, in remote feudal times, for the worst purposes of a\\u00a0donjon-keep, and, in later days, as a place of deposit for powder, or some other highly combustible substance, as a portion of its floor, and the whole interior of a long archway through which we reached it, were carefully sheathed with copper. The door, of massive iron, had been, also, similarly protected. Its immense weight caused an unusually sharp grating sound, as it moved upon its hinges.\\nHaving deposited our mournful burden upon tressels within this region of horror, we partially turned aside the yet unscrewed lid of the coffin, and looked upon the face of the tenant. A striking similitude between the brother and sister now first arrested my attention; and Usher, divining, perhaps, my thoughts, murmured out some few words from which I learned that the deceased and himself had been twins, and that sympathies of a scarcely intelligible nature had always existed between them. Our glances, however, rested not long upon the dead \\u2013 for we could not regard her unawed. The disease which had thus entombed the lady in the maturity of youth, had left, as usual in all maladies of a strictly\\u00a0cataleptical\\u00a0character, the mockery of a faint blush upon the bosom and the face, and that suspiciously lingering smile upon the lip which is so terrible in death. We replaced and screwed down the lid, and, having secured the door of iron, made our way, with toll, into the scarcely less gloomy apartments of the upper portion of the house.\\nAnd now, some days of bitter grief having elapsed, an observable change came over the features of the mental disorder of my friend. His ordinary manner had vanished. His ordinary occupations were neglected or forgotten. He roamed from chamber to chamber with hurried, unequal, and objectless step. The pallor of his countenance had assumed, if possible, a more ghastly hue \\u2013 but the luminousness of his eye had utterly gone out. The once occasional huskiness of his tone was heard no more; and a tremulous quaver, as if of extreme terror, habitually characterized his utterance. There were times, indeed, when I thought his unceasingly agitated mind was labouring with some oppressive secret, to divulge which he struggled for the necessary courage. At times, again, I was obliged to resolve all into the mere inexplicable vagaries of madness, for I beheld him gazing upon vacancy for long hours, in an attitude of the profoundest attention, as if listening to some imaginary sound. It was no wonder that his condition terrified-that it infected me. I felt creeping upon me, by slow yet certain degrees, the wild influences of his own fantastic yet impressive superstitions.\\nIt was, especially, upon retiring to bed late in the night of the seventh or eighth day after the placing of the lady Madeline within the donjon, that I experienced the full power of such feelings. Sleep came not near my couch \\u2013 while the hours waned and waned away. I struggled to reason off the nervousness which had dominion over me. I endeavoured to believe that much, if not all of what I felt, was due to the bewildering influence of the gloomy furniture of the room \\u2013 of the dark and tattered draperies, which, tortured into motion by the breath of a rising\\u00a0tempest, swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls, and rustled uneasily about the decorations of the bed. But my efforts were fruitless. An irrepressible tremour gradually pervaded my frame; and, at length, there sat upon my very heart an\\u00a0incubus\\u00a0of utterly causeless alarm. Shaking this off with a gasp and a struggle, I uplifted myself upon the pillows, and, peering earnestly within the intense darkness of the chamber, hearkened \\u2013 I know not why, except that an instinctive spirit prompted me \\u2013 to certain low and indefinite sounds which came, through the pauses of the storm, at long intervals, I knew not whence. Overpowered by an intense sentiment of horror, unaccountable yet unendurable, I threw on my clothes with haste (for I felt that I should sleep no more during the night), and endeavoured to arouse myself from the pitiable condition into which I had fallen, by pacing rapidly to and fro through the apartment.\\nI had taken but few turns in this manner, when a light step on an adjoining staircase arrested my attention. I presently recognised it as that of Usher. In an instant afterward he rapped, with a gentle touch, at my door, and entered, bearing a lamp. His countenance was, as usual,\\u00a0cadaverously\\u00a0wan \\u2013 but, moreover, there was a species of mad hilarity in his eyes \\u2013 an evidently restrained hysteria in his whole demeanour. His air appalled me \\u2013 but anything was preferable to the solitude which I had so long endured, and I even welcomed his presence as a relief.\\n\\u201cAnd you have not seen it?\\u201d he said abruptly, after having stared about him for some moments in silence \\u2013 \\u201cyou have not then seen it? \\u2013 but, stay! you shall.\\u201d Thus speaking, and having carefully shaded his lamp, he hurried to one of the casements, and threw it freely open to the storm.\\nThe impetuous fury of the entering gust nearly lifted us from our feet. It was, indeed, a\\u00a0tempestuous\\u00a0yet sternly beautiful night, and one wildly singular in its terror and its beauty. A whirlwind had apparently collected its force in our vicinity; for there were frequent and violent alterations in the direction of the wind; and the exceeding density of the clouds (which hung so low as to press upon the turrets of the house) did not prevent our perceiving the life-like velocity with which they flew careering from all points against each other, without passing away into the distance. I say that even their exceeding density did not prevent our perceiving this \\u2013 yet we had no glimpse of the moon or stars \\u2013 nor was there any flashing forth of the lightning. But the under surfaces of the huge masses of agitated vapour, as well as all terrestrial objects immediately around us, were glowing in the unnatural light of a faintly luminous and distinctly visible gaseous exhalation which hung about and enshrouded the mansion.\\n\\u201cYou must not \\u2013 you shall not behold this!\\u201d said I, shudderingly, to Usher, as I led him, with a gentle violence, from the window to a seat. \\u201cThese appearances, which bewilder you, are merely electrical phenomena not uncommon \\u2013 or it may be that they have their ghastly origin in the rank miasma of the\\u00a0tarn. Let us close this casement; \\u2013 the air is chilling and dangerous to your frame. Here is one of your favourite romances. I will read, and you shall listen; \\u2013 and so we will pass away this terrible night together.\\u201d\\nThe antique volume which I had taken up was the Mad Trist of Sir Launcelot Canning; but I had called it a favourite of Usher\\u2019s more in sad jest than in earnest; for, in truth, there is little in its uncouth and unimaginative prolixity which could have had interest for the lofty and spiritual ideality of my friend. It was, however, the only book immediately at hand; and I indulged a vague hope that the excitement which now agitated the hypochondriac, might find relief (for the history of mental disorder is full of similar anomalies) even in the extremeness of the folly which I should read. Could I have judged, indeed, by the wild over-strained air of vivacity with which he hearkened, or apparently hearkened, to the words of the tale, I might well have congratulated myself upon the success of my design.\\nI had arrived at that well-known portion of the story where Ethelred, the hero of the Trist, having sought in vain for peaceable admission into the dwelling of the hermit, proceeds to make good an entrance by force. Here, it will be remembered, the words of the narrative run thus:\\n\\u201cAnd Ethelred, who was by nature of a doughty heart, and who was now mighty withal, on account of the powerfulness of the wine which he had drunken, waited no longer to hold parley with the hermit, who,\\u00a0in sooth, was of an obstinate and maliceful turn, but, feeling the rain upon his shoulders, and fearing the rising of the\\u00a0tempest, uplifted his mace outright, and, with blows, made quickly room in the plankings of the door for his gauntleted hand; and now pulling there-with sturdily, he so cracked, and ripped, and tore all asunder, that the noise of the dry and hollow-sounding wood alarumed and reverberated throughout the forest.\\nAt the termination of this sentence I started, and for a moment, paused; for it appeared to me (although I at once concluded that my excited fancy had deceived me) \\u2013 it appeared to me that, from some very remote portion of the mansion, there came, indistinctly, to my ears, what might have been, in its exact similarity of character, the echo (but a stifled and dull one certainly) of the very cracking and ripping sound which Sir Launcelot had so particularly described. It was, beyond doubt, the coincidence alone which had arrested my attention; for, amid the rattling of the sashes of the casements, and the ordinary commingled noises of the still increasing storm, the sound, in itself, had nothing, surely, which should have interested or disturbed me. I continued the story:\\n\\u201cBut the good champion Ethelred, now entering within the door, was sore enraged and amazed to perceive no signal of the maliceful hermit; but, in the stead thereof, a dragon of a scaly and\\u00a0prodigious\\u00a0demeanour, and of a fiery tongue, which\\u00a0sate\\u00a0in guard before a palace of gold, with a floor of silver; and upon the wall there hung a shield of shining brass with this legend enwritten \\u2013\\n\\n\\n\\nWho entereth herein, a conqueror hath bin;\\nWho slayeth the dragon, the shield he shall win;\\nand Ethelred uplifted his mace, and struck upon the head of the dragon, which fell before him, and gave up his pesty breath, with a shriek so horrid and harsh, and withal so piercing, that Ethelred had fain to close his ears with his hands against the dreadful noise of it, the like whereof was never before heard.\\u201d\\nHere again I paused abruptly, and now with a feeling of wild amazement \\u2013 for there could be no doubt whatever that, in this instance, I did actually hear (although from what direction it proceeded I found it impossible to say) a low and apparently distant, but harsh, protracted, and most unusual screaming or grating sound \\u2013 the exact counterpart of what my fancy had already conjured up for the dragon\\u2019s unnatural shriek as described by the romancer.\\nOppressed, as I certainly was, upon the occurrence of the second and most extraordinary coincidence, by a thousand conflicting sensations, in which wonder and extreme terror were predominant, I still retained sufficient presence of mind to avoid exciting, by any observation, the sensitive nervousness of my companion. I was by no means certain that he had noticed the sounds in question; although, assuredly, a strange alteration had, during the last few minutes, taken place in his demeanour. From a position fronting my own, he had gradually brought round his chair, so as to sit with his face to the door of the chamber; and thus I could but partially perceive his features, although I saw that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring inaudibly. His head had dropped upon his breast \\u2013 yet I knew that he was not asleep, from the wide and rigid opening of the eye as I caught a glance of it in profile. The motion of his body, too, was at variance with this idea \\u2013 for he rocked from side to side with a gentle yet constant and uniform sway. Having rapidly taken notice of all this, I resumed the narrative of Sir Launcelot, which thus proceeded:\\n\\u201cAnd now, the champion, having escaped from the terrible fury of the dragon, bethinking himself of the brazen shield, and of the breaking up of the enchantment which was upon it, removed the carcass from out of the way before him, and approached valorously over the silver pavement of the castle to where the shield was upon the wall; which\\u00a0in sooth\\u00a0tarried not for his full coming, but fell down at his feet upon the silver floor, with a mighty great and terrible ringing sound.\\u201d\\nNo sooner had these syllables passed my lips, than \\u2013 as if a shield of brass had indeed, at the moment, fallen heavily upon a floor of silver, became aware of a distinct, hollow, metallic, and clangorous, yet apparently muffled reverberation. Completely unnerved, I leaped to my feet; but the measured rocking movement of Usher was undisturbed. I rushed to the chair in which he sat. His eyes were bent fixedly before him, and throughout his whole countenance there reigned a stony rigidity. But, as I placed my hand upon his shoulder, there came a strong shudder over his whole person; a sickly smile quivered about his lips; and I saw that he spoke in a low, hurried, and gibbering murmur, as if unconscious of my presence. Bending closely over him, I at length drank in the hideous import of his words.\\n\\u201cNot hear it? \\u2013 yes, I hear it, and have heard it. Long \\u2013 long \\u2013 long \\u2013 many minutes, many hours, many days, have I heard it \\u2013 yet I dared not \\u2013 oh, pity me, miserable wretch that I am! \\u2013 I dared not \\u2013 I dared not speak! We have put her living in the tomb! Said I not that my senses were\\u00a0acute? I now tell you that I heard her first feeble movements in the hollow coffin. I heard them \\u2013 many, many days ago \\u2013 yet I dared not \\u2013 I dared not speak! And now \\u2013 to-night \\u2013 Ethelred \\u2013 ha! ha! \\u2013 the breaking of the hermit\\u2019s door, and the death-cry of the dragon, and the clangour of the shield! \\u2013 say, rather, the rending of her coffin, and the grating of the iron hinges of her prison, and her struggles within the coppered archway of the vault! Oh whither shall I fly? Will she not be here anon? Is she not hurrying to upbraid me for my haste? Have I not heard her footstep on the stair? Do I not distinguish that heavy and horrible beating of her heart? MADMAN!\\u201d here he sprang furiously to his feet, and shrieked out his syllables, as if in the effort he were giving up his soul \\u2013 \\u201cMADMAN! I TELL YOU THAT SHE NOW STANDS WITHOUT THE DOOR!\\u201d\\nAs if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there had been found the potency of a spell \\u2013 the huge antique panels to which the speaker pointed, threw slowly back, upon the instant, ponderous and ebony jaws. It was the work of the rushing gust \\u2013 but then without those doors there DID stand the lofty and enshrouded figure of the lady Madeline of Usher. There was blood upon her white robes, and the evidence of some bitter struggle upon every portion of her emaciated frame. For a moment she remained trembling and reeling to and fro upon the threshold, then, with a low moaning cry, fell heavily inward upon the person of her brother, and in her violent and now final death-agonies, bore him to the floor a corpse, and a victim to the terrors he had anticipated.\\nFrom that chamber, and from that mansion, I fled\\u00a0aghast. The storm was still abroad in all its wrath as I found myself crossing the old causeway. Suddenly there shot along the path a wild light, and I turned to see whence a gleam so unusual could have issued; for the vast house and its shadows were alone behind me. The radiance was that of the full, setting, and blood-red moon which now shone vividly through that once barely-discernible fissure of which I have before spoken as extending from the roof of the building, in a zig-zag direction, to the base. While I gazed, this fissure rapidly widened \\u2013 there came a fierce breath of the whirlwind \\u2013 the entire orb of the satellite burst at once upon my sight \\u2013 my brain reeled as I saw the mighty walls rushing asunder \\u2013 there was a long tumultuous shouting sound like the voice of a thousand waters \\u2013 and the deep and dank\\u00a0tarn\\u00a0at my feet closed sullenly and silently over the fragments of the \\u201cHOUSE OF USHER.\\u201d\\n* * *\\nNOTES\\n1. The epigraph at the beginning of Edgar Allan Poe\\u2019s \\u201cThe Fall of the House of Usher,\\u201d taken from a poem by Pierre Jean de B\\u00e9ranger, serves as a metaphorical preface to the story\\u2019s themes and atmosphere. The lines, \\u201cSon c\\u0153ur est un luth suspendu; Sit\\u00f4t qu\\u2019on le touche il r\\u00e9sonne,\\u201d translate to \\u201cHis heart is a lute suspended; As soon as one touches it, it resonates.\\u201d\\nThis epigraph suggests a sensitivity to external influences, symbolizing the delicate and responsive nature of the human psyche. In the context of the story, it foreshadows the intense emotional and psychological states of the characters, particularly Roderick Usher, whose mental and physical condition is highly susceptible to his environment. The Usher family home, a Gothic mansion that is almost a character in its own right, acts as an external embodiment of Roderick\\u2019s internal state, with its decaying structure mirroring his deteriorating mind. The epigraph hints at the central themes of the story: the interplay between the physical and psychological, the impact of the past on the present, and the idea that both the human mind and the environments we inhabit are easily affected by stimuli, capable of producing profound reactions to seemingly minor provocations. It sets the stage for a tale where atmosphere, setting, and emotion resonate together, much like the strings of a lute respond to a touch.\\n2.

Beneath the surface of Arrakis\\u2019 golden dunes and political intrigue lies a profound environmental allegory that resonates with ecological themes. Let\\u2019s delve into the intricacies of Herbert\\u2019s eco-conscious masterpiece and explore how Arrakis becomes a compelling allegory for environmental challenges.\\nThe Spice Melange as a Finite Resource: At the heart of Arrakis\\u2019 environmental allegory is the spice melange, a substance that grants heightened awareness and the ability to fold space. Analogous to Earth\\u2019s limited resources, the spice serves as a metaphor for humanity\\u2019s reliance on finite commodities. Herbert ingeniously uses the spice to explore the consequences of unchecked exploitation and the ethical dilemmas surrounding resource management.\\nThe Fremen\\u2019s Water Discipline: Water, the most precious resource on Arrakis, takes center stage in the Fremen\\u2019s daily lives. Herbert mirrors our planet\\u2019s struggle with water scarcity through the Fremen\\u2019s meticulous water discipline. The stillsuits, worn by the Fremen to reclaim and recycle bodily fluids, echo our real-world need for sustainable water practices in the face of a changing climate.\\nSandworms and Ecological Balance: The colossal sandworms, guardians of the spice, symbolize the delicate ecological balance on Arrakis. Herbert prompts readers to reflect on the consequences of disrupting ecosystems, drawing parallels to Earth\\u2019s ecosystems where the extinction of a single species can have cascading effects. The sandworms, majestic and mysterious, embody the interconnectedness of life on Arrakis.\\nNoble Houses and Resource Exploitation: Arrakis becomes a microcosm of our own planet\\u2019s struggles with resource exploitation. The noble houses, eager to control the spice trade, mirror corporations and nations exploiting Earth\\u2019s resources for economic gain. Herbert\\u2019s narrative invites readers to question the ethics of resource extraction and the long-term consequences of prioritizing profit over planetary well-being.\\nHerbert\\u2019s Visionary Environmentalism: Long before environmental consciousness became a mainstream concern, Herbert was weaving a narrative that anticipated the ecological challenges of the future. \\u201cDune\\u201d serves as a cautionary tale, urging readers to consider the impact of their actions on the environment. Herbert\\u2019s visionary environmentalism remains relevant as societies grapple with climate change and the consequences of unfettered industrialization.\\nAdaptations and Contemporary Relevance: As \\u201cDune\\u201d makes its way to the big screen, filmmakers face the challenge of translating Herbert\\u2019s environmental allegory into a visual medium. Each adaptation provides an opportunity to revisit Arrakis and its ecological message, prompting audiences to reflect on the environmental challenges confronting our own world.\\nConclusion: \\u201cDune\\u201d as an Ecological Parable: In the sands of Arrakis, Frank Herbert crafted more than a science fiction epic; he created an allegory for our planet\\u2019s environmental struggles. \\u201cDune\\u201d challenges readers to confront the consequences of environmental exploitation and advocates for a mindful approach to resource management. As we navigate the intricate political landscape of Arrakis, Herbert\\u2019s environmental allegory invites us to consider the impact of our choices on Earth, making \\u201cDune\\u201d not just a classic of science fiction but a timeless reflection on our planet\\u2019s ecological destiny.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\",\n          \"\\n \\nVyvyan Holland, in his introduction to the 1966 edition of Oscar Wilde\\u2019s works, provides an insightful overview of his father\\u2019s lineage, life, and literary career. He recounts the family\\u2019s Dutch origin, Oscar\\u2019s upbringing and education, his rise in London society, and his contributions to literature, from poetry and essays to renowned plays like The Importance of Being Earnest. Holland also touches on the darker aspects of Wilde\\u2019s life, including his trial, imprisonment, and posthumous conversion to Catholicism, ultimately painting a complex and enduring portrait of one of the most celebrated figures in literary history.\\n* * *\\nINTRODUCTION TO THE 1966 EDITION\\nby Vyvyan Holland\\nOscar Wilde\\u2019s family is Dutch in origin. The first Wilde to settle in Ireland was a certain Colonel de Wilde, the son of an artist, examples of whose work hang in the Art Gallery at The Hague; he was a soldier of fortune who was granted lands in Connaught at the end of the seventeenth century for his services to King William III of England. He is said to have repented his adherence to the English king and to have become \\u2018more Irish than the Irish\\u2019. From that time the family were land agents and doctors.\\nMy father\\u2019s parents were both distinguished in their own way. Sir William Wilde was the foremost eye and ear specialist of his time, and a physician of international repute. He invented the operation for cataract and performed it on King Oscar of Sweden, for which he received the Order of the Polar Star. His mother, Lady Wilde, born Jane Francesca Elgee, was a staunch Irish Nationalist, who wrote fierce poems and articles in the Irish Nationalist newspaper The Nation, under the name of \\u2018Speranza\\u2019, a name she had adopted from her motto \\u2018Fidanza, Constanza, Speranza\\u2019 \\u2013 Faith, Constancy, Hope. Lady Wilde had three children, William, Oscar and Isola, who died when she was ten, to Oscar\\u2019s lasting grief. Oscar Wilde was born on 16 October 1854, and was given the names Oscar Fingal O\\u2019Flahertie Wills Wilde.\\nHis education began at Portora Royal School In Enniskillen, from which he obtained a scholarship to Trinity College, Dublin, where he won the Berkeley Gold Medal for Greek. From there he received a demyship to Magdalen College, Oxford. While at Oxford he came under the Influence of John Ruskin and Walter Pater. Pater preached the love of Art for Art\\u2019s sake, and Oscar Wilde, going one step further, set out to idolise beauty for beauty\\u2019s sake and filled his rooms looking over the Cherwell with blue china and reproductions of paintings by Rossetti and Burne-Jones. Aestheticism was the key-note of his creed and he declared that beauty was the ideal after which everyone should strive.\\nMy father\\u2019s life at Oxford, one gathers from his letters, was a joyous one. He entered whole-heartedly into the undergraduate life of the University and distinguished himself by winning the Newdigate Prize for English verse and getting a double first in Classics. Upon this note he came to London in 1879 with the remains of a small patrimony and started to make his living by his pen. True to his doctrine of beauty he established himself as the \\u2018Apostle of Aestheticism\\u2019 and drew attention to himself by the eccentricity of his dress. It must be remembered that at this period the clothing of the British upper middle classes was rigidly conventional, and the sight of him in the evening in a velvet coat edged with braid, knee-breeches, black silk stockings, a soft loose shirt with a wide turn-down collar and a large flowing tie, was bound to arouse indignant curiosity.\\nAt the same time he was writing poems, and in 1880 he also wrote Vera, a rather immature play, which ran for one week in New York in 1883 and never reached the boards in London. In 1881 his collected poems were published, and in 1882, being short of money, he was persuaded to go on a lecture tour to America. This proved to be a brilliant success and he returned to England in 1883, covered, if not with glory, at least with considerable notoriety.\\nOn his return to Europe, he retired to Paris to finish another play, The Duchess of Padua, for the American actress Mary Anderson; but when she received the play, she turned it down flatly. This was really a disaster for Oscar Wilde, and he returned to England and went on a series of lecture tours in the provinces. However, this nomadic life soon palled and he returned to London where, in 1884, he married Constance Mary, daughter of a distinguished Irish barrister, Horace Lloyd, Q.C. Oscar was romantically in love with his beautiful young wife and for some years he was ideally happy. He had two sons by his wife \\u2013 Cyril, born in 1885, and myself in 1886.\\nOddly enough, although his literary activities had been almost entirely confined to writing poetry until his marriage, he now turned largely to prose and, with the exception of The Sphinx, the idea of which had occurred to him much earlier, he wrote few poems until after his imprisonment, when he wrote The Ballad of Reading Gaol. Boris Brasol, who wrote one of the only two carefully considered lives of my father, sums up his poetic period as follows:\\n\\u2018He began his literary career as a composer of sonorous and pleasing verses in which, however, as he himself admitted, \\u2018there was more rhyme than reason\\u2019; yet as he grew older, he seemed to have lost all taste for poetry, and though there Is nothing that would justify the contention that he ever regarded his early poems as callow productions, the fact remains that upon reaching maturity he took no further interest in that delightful occupation which Browning aptly called \\u201cthe unlocking of hearts with sonnet keys\\u201d.\\u2019\\nUpon what, then, does his reputation as an author rest? His early poems were mostly lyrical, and certain of them will undoubtedly pass the test of time. His true literary life was spread over seven years only, from 1888 until 1894. In 1887 he had become editor of Woman\\u2019s World in which capacity he continued until 1889 when he resigned. He had gathered a reputation for eccentricity and, still more, as a conversationalist. There are few people alive now who remember his conversation, but when in 1954 a plaque was unveiled by Sir Compton Mackenzie on the house in Tite Street where my family lived for eleven years, he read the following message from Sir Max Beerbohm (the Incomparable Max!), who felt too frail to undertake the journey to London to be present:\\n\\u2018I have had the privilege of listening to many masters of table talk \\u2013 Meredith and Swinburne, Edmund Gosse and Henry James, Augustine Birrell and Arthur Balfour, Gilbert Chesterton and Desmond MacCarthy and Hilaire Belloc \\u2013 all of them splendid in their own way. But Oscar was the greatest of them all \\u2013 the most spontaneous and yet the most polished, the most soothing and yet the most surprising\\u2026Nobody was willing to interrupt the music of so magnificent a virtuoso. To have heard him consoled me for not having heard Dr Johnson or Edmund Burke, Lord Brougham or Sidney Smith.\\u2019\\nWinston Churchill was once asked whom he would like to meet and talk with in after life, and he replied, without hesitation: \\u2018Oscar Wilde.\\u2019\\nWilde\\u2019s first memorable work was The Happy Prince, which appeared in 1888. The stories in The Happy Prince are really poems in prose more than fairytales for children; and yet the remarkable thing is that they appeal equally to children and adults.\\nIn 1891 he produced a small volume ot tour stories which he had written some time previously. The book was called Lord Arthur Savile\\u2019s Crime and Other Stories, the other three tales being The Canterville Ghost\\u2019, The Sphinx without a Secret\\u2019 and \\u2018The Model Millionaire\\u2019. The first two of these stories have been dramatised and their substance has been copied on several occasions; they possess the light-hearted gaiety and insouciance that find their fullest expression in The Importance of Being Earnest, and show the buoyancy of my father\\u2019s spirit at that time.\\nA House of Pomegranates, my father\\u2019s other book of short stories \\u2013 one can hardly call them fairy tales \\u2013 appeared with illustrations by Charles Shannon, R.A. in the same year. This book completely puzzled the critics, who thought that the stories were meant for children and protested, quite rightly, that no child could understand them. This was followed by The Sphinx, which really dated from his Oxford days, and upon which he had worked at intervals ever since. The critics were again confused by the poem, which was really nothing more than an experiment with words. He revelled in finding rhymes for words such as hieroglyph and catafalque, which he rhymed with hippogriff and Amenalk.\\nIn 1891, too, Oscar Wilde\\u2019s only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, appeared in book form, enlarged from the original which had been already published in Lippincott\\u2019s Magazine. The publication of this work was greeted with a storm of protest by the critics. The English Press was almost unanimous in its condemnation of the book. The Idea of the book had first come to my father some years before. Hesketh Pearson tells the story of it in his Life of Oscar Wilde;\\u2019 In the year 1884 Wilde used to drop in at the studio of a painter, Basil Ward, one of whose sitters was a young man of exceptional beauty\\u2026When the portrait was done and the youth had gone, Wilde happened to say, \\u201cWhat a pity that such a glorious creature should ever grow old!\\u201d The artist agreed, adding, \\u201cHow delightful it would be if he could remain exactly as he is, while the portrait aged and withered in his stead!\\u201d Wilde expressed his obligation by calling the painter in his story Basil Hallward.\\u2019\\nBy far the most interesting and entertaining book of essays that Oscar Wilde wrote was Intentions, in which he really gave rein to his imagination. In my own opinion, it is the most absorbing of all his works. The Critic as Artist occupies considerably more than half of it; its sub-title \\u2018with some remarks upon the importance of doing nothing\\u2019 shows the curious charm the word \\u2018importance\\u2019 had for him; it occurs in the titles of two of his plays, and is constantly cropping up in his essays. It is almost as though the word held a strange sonorousness for him and that he liked to roll it, if not round his tongue, then round his mind.\\nBut the most interesting essay in the book is The Decay of Lying. The essay is in the form of a dialogue, the dominant theme being the vast superiority of Art over Nature, leading to the conclusion that Nature follows Art.\\nOscar Wilde now entered into his final stage, the one for which he was destined, that of a dramatist. In 1891 he wrote Lady Windermere\\u2019s Fan, which he described as \\u2018one of those modern drawing-room plays with pink lampshades\\u2019. It was produced at the St James\\u2019s Theatre in February, 1892 by George Alexander. There were loud cries of \\u2018Author!\\u2019 at the end of the play and Wilde came onto the stage with a cigarette in his gloved hand and said: \\u2018Ladies and Gentlemen. I have enjoyed this evening immensely. The actors have given us a charming rendering of a delightful play, and your appreciation has been most intelligent. I congratulate you on the great success of your performance which persuades me that you think almost as highly of the play as I do.\\u2019\\nWhen Wilde had finished Lady Windermere\\u2019s Fan he retired to Paris and wrote his Biblical play Salome in French, dedicated to Pierre Louys who made certain corrections in the French, but did not otherwise interfere with it. Sarah Bernhardt was immensely attracted to this play, and she put it into rehearsal at the Palace Theatre in London, with herself in the title-role. However, the Lord Chamberlain refused to grant it a licence, on the ground that no play which contained Biblical characters was allowed to be performed on the English stage. This so annoyed Wilde that he announced his intentions of renouncing his British nationality and becoming a Frenchman, there being no such restrictions in France. As matters turned out, it is a pity that he did not carry out his threat.\\nIn the summer of 1892 he wrote A Woman of No Importance, which was produced with immediate success by Herbert Beerbohm Tree at the Haymarket in 1893. Once again the audience rose to its feet and called for the author. This time remembering the bad impression he had made on the first night of Lady Windermere\\u2019s Fan, he got up in the box in which he was sitting and announced: \\u2018Ladies and Gentlemen, I regret to inform you that Mr Oscar Wilde is not in the house.\\u2019\\nOn 3 January 1895, Oscar Wilde\\u2019s third important play An Ideal Husband was produced by Lewis Waller. The Prince of Wales was present at the first night. It was almost unprecedented for Royalty to be present at a first night, and it seemed now that Wilde\\u2019s future was assured. George Bernard Shaw\\u2019s comment on the play is worth repeating: \\u2018Mr Oscar Wilde\\u2019s new play at the Haymarket is a dangerous subject, because he has the property of making his critics dull\\u2026He plays with everything; with wit, with philosophy, with drama, with actors and audience, with the whole theatre.\\u2019\\nAnd so we come to Oscar Wilde\\u2019s last, and his most brilliant play, The Importance of Being Earnest. Wilde originally wrote the play in four acts, as he had written his other three major plays. He submitted it in this form to George Alexander who, with the object of making room for a \\u2018curtain raiser\\u2019, as was usual in those days, asked Wilde to cut it to three acts. When, four years later, Leonard Smithers published the play in book form, it was this three-act version that he had printed, and each subsequent edition has followed this pattern. Why this has been so is not clear, but the play as written by Oscar Wilde, with two extra characters in it, is the play as given in this volume. As Mr Philip Drake, who is responsible for this edition of Wilde\\u2019s works, remarked, it seems a pity that George Alexander should have a permanent influence on the play.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Importance of Being Earnestwas produced at the St James\\u2019s Theatre on 14 February 1895. Wilde had now reached the pinnacle of his success. Two plays of his were drawing crowded audiences in the West End, and actormanagers were falling over one another to beg him to write for them. Then the Marquess of Queensberry, with the object of attacking his son, Lord Alfred Douglas, because of his friendship with Wilde, launched a campaign of ungovernable fury on Wilde. The story has been told often enough; Alfred Douglas, whose only object was to see his father in the dock, persuaded Oscar Wilde to bring a prosecution for criminal libel against him. Lord Queensberry was triumphantly acquitted and his place in the dock was taken by Oscar Wilde, who was sentenced to two years imprisonment.\\nWhile in prison, Wilde wrote the letter to Lord Alfred Douglas, part of which was published in 1905 by Robert Ross, under the title of De Profundis. In a letter to Robert Ross he wrote: \\u2018This is indeed an Encyclical letter, and as the Bulls of the Holy Father are named from their opening words, it may be spoken of as Epistola: in Carcere el Vinculis.\\u2019 The manuscript was not revised by Wilde, although he intended to do this, as is shown by the letter he wrote to Robert Ross: \\u2018As soon as you have read it, I want you to have it copied for me. As regards the method of copying, I wish the copy to be done on good paper and a wide rubricated margin should be left for corrections.\\u2019 A copy of De Profundis was made and sent to Alfred Douglas; but after reading the first few pages, he destroyed it, probably thinking, rather naively, that there was no other copy in existence. Douglas strenuously denied ever having received the letter, and he could not go back on this without contradicting himself.\\nAfter my father\\u2019s death in 1900, Alfred Douglas tried to get hold of the manuscript, but Robert Ross settled the matter by sealing it up and presenting it to the British Museum, with the proviso that it should remain sealed for sixty years, that is to say until 1960, at the end of which time it might safely be presumed that everyone mentioned in it would be dead.\\nThe copying was done hastily and without much care, because the version printed in 1949 varied in several particulars from the original manuscript, although, of course, the substance was the same. The version here printed has been carefully compared with the original and is exactly as Wilde wrote it.\\nThe Portrait of Mr. W. H. was first published as an article of 12,000 words in Blackwood\\u2019s Magazine for July, 1889. Oscar Wilde became more and more obsessed with the idea contained in the article and during the next four years he re-wrote the story and added to it, bringing the total up to 25,000 words. The manuscript disappeared at the time of the sale of my father\\u2019s effects at Tite Street, together with others, and did not re-appear until the year 1920 in America, where it was published in a limited edition by Mitchell Kennerley. The expanded version is printed in this edition.\\nThe only work that my father wrote after 1897 was the poem The Ballad of Reading Gaol, which he wrote at Berneval, so that Douglas\\u2019s claim to have had a large share in writing it may be ignored, as he and Wilde did not meet again until later.\\nAll his life, my father had an intense leaning towards religious mysticism and was strongly attracted to the Catholic Church, into which he was received on his death bed in 1900. His remains now lie in the French National Cemetery of Pere Lachaise.\\nSOURCE: Complete Works of Oscar Wilde, with an introduction by Vyvyan Holland, Collins, 1966\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"full_name\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"EDGAR \",\n          \"VYVYAN HOLLAND\",\n          \"HENRY DAVID\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"polarity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.0661302833744263,\n        \"min\": 0.037532171063277005,\n        \"max\": 0.2080952380952381,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.037532171063277005,\n          0.2080952380952381,\n          0.17556973615678065\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subjectivity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.041643130499489645,\n        \"min\": 0.428145227788085,\n        \"max\": 0.534657540421733,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.5177623835457936,\n          0.5278869047619049,\n          0.45590927740725323\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Roderick\\u2019s twin sister, Madeline, is gravely ill with a mysterious condition that leaves her cataleptic. The narrative unfolds in a gloomy atmosphere, filled with foreboding and supernatural elements, as the narrator witnesses the psychological disintegration of Roderick and the bizarre events leading up to Madeline\\u2019s death and terrifying return from the grave. The story culminates in the literal and metaphorical collapse of the Usher house into the dark tarn that mirrors it, symbolizing the end of the Usher family line and the inescapable doom of their ancient curse. Poe masterfully weaves themes of fear, isolation, and madness, creating a quintessential Gothic tale that explores the depths of human despair and the fragility of the psyche.\\n* * *\\nby Edgar Allan Poe\\nSon c\\u0153ur est un luth suspendu;\\nSit\\u00f4t qu\\u2019on le touche il r\\u00e9sonne.\\n\\u2014De B\\u00e9ranger.1\\nDuring the whole of a dull, dark, and soundless day in the autumn of the year, when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens, I had been passing alone, on horseback, through a singularly dreary tract of country; and at length found myself, as the shades of the evening drew on, within view of the melancholy House of Usher. I know not how it was \\u2013 but, with the first glimpse of the building, a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit. I say insufferable; for the feeling was unrelieved by any of that half-pleasurable, because poetic, sentiment, with which the mind usually receives even the sternest natural images of the desolate or terrible. I looked upon the scene before me \\u2013 upon the mere house, and the simple landscape features of the domain \\u2013 upon the bleak walls \\u2013 upon the vacant eye-like windows \\u2013 upon a few rank sedges \\u2013 and upon a few white trunks of decayed trees \\u2013 with an utter depression of soul which I can compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the after-dream of the reveller upon opium \\u2013 the bitter lapse into everyday life \\u2013 the hideous dropping off of the veil. There was an iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the heart \\u2013 an unredeemed dreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could torture into aught of the sublime. What was it \\u2013 I paused to think \\u2013 what was it that so unnerved me in the contemplation of the House of Usher? It was a mystery all insoluble; nor could I grapple with the shadowy fancies that crowded upon me as I pondered. I was forced to fall back upon the unsatisfactory conclusion, that while, beyond doubt, there are combinations of very simple natural objects which have the power of thus affecting us, still the analysis of this power lies among considerations beyond our depth. It was possible, I reflected, that a mere different arrangement of the particulars of the scene, of the details of the picture, would be sufficient to modify, or perhaps to annihilate its capacity for sorrowful impression; and, acting upon this idea, I reined my horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in unruffled lustre by the dwelling, and gazed down \\u2013 but with a shudder even more thrilling than before \\u2013 upon the remodelled and inverted images of the gray sedge, and the ghastly tree-stems, and the vacant and eye-like windows.\\nNevertheless, in this mansion of gloom I now proposed to myself a\\u00a0sojourn\\u00a0of some weeks. Its proprietor, Roderick Usher, had been one of my boon companions in boyhood; but many years had elapsed since our last meeting. A letter, however, had lately reached me in a distant part of the country \\u2013 a letter from him \\u2013 which, in its wildly importunate nature, had admitted of no other than a personal reply. The MS. gave evidence of nervous agitation. The writer spoke of\\u00a0acute\\u00a0bodily illness \\u2013 of a mental disorder which oppressed him \\u2013 and of an earnest desire to see me, as his best, and indeed his only personal friend, with a view of attempting, by the cheerfulness of my society, some alleviation of his malady. It was the manner in which all this, and much more, was said \\u2013 it the apparent heart that went with his request \\u2013 which allowed me no room for hesitation; and I accordingly obeyed forthwith what I still considered a very singular summons.\\nAlthough, as boys, we had been even intimate associates, yet I really knew little of my friend. His reserve had been always excessive and habitual. I was aware, however, that his very ancient family had been noted, time out of mind, for a peculiar sensibility of temperament, displaying itself, through long ages, in many works of exalted art, and manifested, of late, in repeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive charity, as well as in a passionate devotion to the intricacies, perhaps even more than to the orthodox and easily recognisable beauties, of musical science. I had learned, too, the very remarkable fact, that the stem of the Usher race, all time-honoured as it was, had put forth, at no period, any enduring branch; in other words, that the entire family lay in the direct line of descent, and had always, with very trifling and very temporary variation, so lain. It was this deficiency, I considered, while running over in thought the perfect keeping of the character of the premises with the accredited character of the people, and while speculating upon the possible influence which the one, in the long lapse of centuries, might have exercised upon the other \\u2013 it was this deficiency, perhaps, of collateral issue, and the consequent undeviating transmission, from sire to son, of the patrimony with the name, which had, at length, so identified the two as to merge the original title of the estate in the quaint and\\u00a0equivocal\\u00a0appellation of the \\u201cHouse of Usher\\u201d \\u2013 an appellation which seemed to include, in the minds of the peasantry who used it, both the family and the family mansion.\\nI have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish experiment \\u2013 that of looking down within the\\u00a0tarn \\u2013 had been to deepen the first singular impression. There can be no doubt that the consciousness of the rapid increase of my superstition \\u2013 for why should I not so term it? \\u2013 served mainly to accelerate the increase itself. Such, I have long known, is the\\u00a0paradoxical\\u00a0law of all sentiments having terror as a basis. And it might have been for this reason only, that, when I again uplifted my eyes to the house itself, from its image in the pool, there grew in my mind a strange fancy \\u2013 a fancy so ridiculous, indeed, that I but mention it to show the vivid force of the sensations which oppressed me. I had so worked upon my imagination as really to believe that about the whole mansion and domain there hung an atmosphere peculiar to themselves and their immediate vicinity-an atmosphere which had no affinity with the air of heaven, but which had reeked up from the decayed trees, and the gray wall, and the silent\\u00a0tarn \\u2013 a pestilent and mystic vapour, dull, sluggish, faintly discernible, and leaden-hued.\\nShaking off from my spirit what must have been a dream, I scanned more narrowly the real aspect of the building. Its principal feature seemed to be that of an excessive antiquity. The discoloration of ages had been great. Minute fungi overspread the whole exterior, hanging in a fine tangled web-work from the eaves. Yet all this was apart from any extraordinary dilapidation. No portion of the masonry had fallen; and there appeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfect adaptation of parts, and the crumbling condition of the individual stones. In this there was much that reminded me of the specious totality of old wood-work which has rotted for long years in some neglected vault, with no disturbance from the breath of the external air. Beyond this indication of extensive decay, however, the fabric gave little token of instability. Perhaps the eye of a scrutinising observer might have discovered a barely perceptible fissure, which, extending from the roof of the building in front, made its way down the wall in a zigzag direction, until it became lost in the\\u00a0sullen\\u00a0waters of the\\u00a0tarn.\\nNoticing these things, I rode over a short causeway to the house. A servant in waiting took my horse, and I entered the Gothic archway of the hall. A valet, of stealthy step, thence conducted me, in silence, through many dark and intricate passages in my progress to the studio of his master. Much that I encountered on the way contributed, I know not how, to heighten the vague sentiments of which I have already spoken. While the objects around me \\u2013 while the carvings of the ceilings, the sombre tapestries of the walls, the ebon blackness of the floors, and the\\u00a0phantasmagoric\\u00a0armorial trophies which rattled as I strode, were but matters to which, or to such as which, I had been accustomed from my infancy \\u2013 while I hesitated not to acknowledge how familiar was all this \\u2013 I still wondered to find how unfamiliar were the fancies which ordinary images were stirring up. On one of the staircases, I met the physician of the family. His countenance, I thought, wore a mingled expression of low cunning and perplexity. He accosted me with\\u00a0trepidation\\u00a0and passed on. The valet now threw open a door and ushered me into the presence of his master.\\nThe room in which I found myself was very large and lofty. The windows were long, narrow, and pointed, and at so vast a distance from the black oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible from within. Feeble gleams of encrimsoned light made their way through the trellised panes, and served to render sufficiently distinct the more prominent objects around; the eye, however, struggled in vain to reach the remoter angles of the chamber, or the recesses of the vaulted and fretted ceiling. Dark draperies hung upon the walls. The general furniture was profuse, comfortless, antique, and tattered. Many books and musical instruments lay scattered about, but failed to give any vitality to the scene. I felt that I breathed an atmosphere of sorrow. An air of stern, deep, and irredeemable gloom hung over and pervaded all.\\nUpon my entrance, Usher arose from a sofa on which he had been lying at full length, and greeted me with a vivacious warmth which had much in it, I at first thought, of an overdone cordiality \\u2013 of the constrained effort of the ennuy\\u00e9 man of the world. A glance, however, at his countenance, convinced me of his perfect sincerity. We sat down; and for some moments, while he spoke not, I gazed upon him with a feeling half of pity, half of awe. Surely, man had never before so terribly altered, in so brief a period, as had Roderick Usher! It was with difficulty that I could bring myself to admit the identity of the wan being before me with the companion of my early boyhood. Yet the character of his face had been at all times remarkable. A cadaverousness of complexion; an eye large, liquid, and luminous beyond comparison; lips somewhat thin and very pallid, but of a surpassingly beautiful curve; a nose of a delicate Hebrew model, but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations; a finely moulded chin, speaking, in its want of prominence, of a want of moral energy; hair of a more than web-like softness and tenuity; these features, with an inordinate expansion above the regions of the temple, made up altogether a countenance not easily to be forgotten. And now in the mere exaggeration of the prevailing character of these features, and of the expression they were wont to convey, lay so much of change that I doubted to whom I spoke. The now ghastly pallor of the skin, and the now miraculous lustre of the eve, above all things startled and even awed me. The silken hair, too, had been suffered to grow all unheeded, and as, in its wild gossamer texture, it floated rather than fell about the face, I could not, even with effort, connect its Arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity.\\nIn the manner of my friend I was at once struck with an incoherence \\u2013 an inconsistency; and I soon found this to arise from a series of feeble and futile struggles to overcome an habitual trepidancy \\u2013 an excessive nervous agitation. For something of this nature I had indeed been prepared, no less by his letter, than by reminiscences of certain boyish traits, and by conclusions deduced from his peculiar physical conformation and temperament. His action was alternately vivacious and\\u00a0sullen. His voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision (when the animal spirits seemed utterly in\\u00a0abeyance) to that species of energetic concision \\u2013 that abrupt, weighty, unhurried, and hollow-sounding enunciation \\u2013 that leaden, self-balanced and perfectly modulated guttural utterance, which may be observed in the lost drunkard, or the irreclaimable eater of opium, during the periods of his most intense excitement.\\nIt was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit, of his earnest desire to see me, and of the solace he expected me to afford him. He entered, at some length, into what he conceived to be the nature of his malady. It was, he said, a constitutional and a family evil, and one for which he despaired to find a remedy \\u2013 a mere nervous affection, he immediately added, which would undoubtedly soon pass off. It displayed itself in a host of unnatural sensations. Some of these, as he detailed them, interested and bewildered me; although, perhaps, the terms, and the general manner of the narration had their weight. He suffered much from a morbid acuteness of the senses; the most insipid food was alone endurable; he could wear only garments of certain texture; the odours of all flowers were oppressive; his eyes were tortured by even a faint light; and there were but peculiar sounds, and these from stringed instruments, which did not inspire him with horror.\\nTo an\\u00a0anomalous\\u00a0species of terror I found him a bounden slave. \\u201cI shall perish,\\u201d said he, \\u201cI must perish in this deplorable folly. Thus, thus, and not otherwise, shall I be lost. I dread the events of the future, not in themselves, but in their results. I shudder at the thought of any, even the most trivial, incident, which may operate upon this intolerable agitation of soul. I have, indeed, no abhorrence of danger, except in its absolute effect \\u2013 in terror. In this unnerved-in this pitiable condition \\u2013 I feel that the period will sooner or later arrive when I must abandon life and reason together, in some struggle with the grim\\u00a0phantasm, FEAR.\\u201d\\nI learned, moreover, at intervals, and through broken and\\u00a0equivocal\\u00a0hints, another singular feature of his mental condition. He was enchained by certain superstitious impressions in regard to the dwelling which he tenanted, and whence, for many years, he had never ventured forth \\u2013 in regard to an influence whose supposititious force was conveyed in terms too shadowy here to be re-stated \\u2013 an influence which some peculiarities in the mere form and substance of his family mansion, had, by\\u00a0dint\\u00a0of long sufferance, he said, obtained over his spirit-an effect which the physique of the gray walls and turrets, and of the dim\\u00a0tarn\\u00a0into which they all looked down, had, at length, brought about upon the morale of his existence.\\nHe admitted, however, although with hesitation, that much of the peculiar gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a more natural and far more\\u00a0palpable\\u00a0origin \\u2013 to the severe and long-continued illness \\u2013 indeed to the evidently approaching dissolution-of a tenderly beloved sister \\u2013 his sole companion for long years \\u2013 his last and only relative on earth. \\u201cHer decease,\\u201d he said, with a bitterness which I can never forget, \\u201cwould leave him (him the hopeless and the frail) the last of the ancient race of the Ushers.\\u201d While he spoke, the lady Madeline (for so was she called) passed slowly through a remote portion of the apartment, and, without having noticed my presence, disappeared. I regarded her with an utter astonishment not unmingled with dread \\u2013 and yet I found it impossible to account for such feelings. A sensation of stupor oppressed me, as my eyes followed her retreating steps. When a door, at length, closed upon her, my glance sought instinctively and eagerly the countenance of the brother \\u2013 but he had buried his face in his hands, and I could only perceive that a far more than ordinary wanness had overspread the emaciated fingers through which trickled many passionate tears.\\nThe disease of the lady Madeline had long baffled the skill of her physicians. A settled apathy, a gradual wasting away of the person, and frequent although transient affections of a partially\\u00a0cataleptical\\u00a0character, were the unusual diagnosis. Hitherto she had steadily borne up against the pressure of her malady, and had not betaken herself finally to bed; but, on the closing in of the evening of my arrival at the house, she succumbed (as her brother told me at night with inexpressible agitation) to the prostrating power of the destroyer; and I learned that the glimpse I had obtained of her person would thus probably be the last I should obtain \\u2013 that the lady, at least while living, would be seen by me no more.\\nFor several days ensuing, her name was unmentioned by either Usher or myself: and during this period I was busied in earnest endeavours to alleviate the melancholy of my friend. We painted and read together; or I listened, as if in a dream, to the wild improvisations of his speaking guitar. And thus, as a closer and still intimacy admitted me more unreservedly into the recesses of his spirit, the more bitterly did I perceive the futility of all attempt at cheering a mind from which darkness, as if an inherent positive quality, poured forth upon all objects of the moral and physical universe, in one unceasing radiation of gloom.\\nI shall ever bear about me a memory of the many solemn hours I thus spent alone with the master of the House of Usher. Yet I should fail in any attempt to convey an idea of the exact character of the studies, or of the occupations, in which he involved me, or led me the way. An excited and highly distempered ideality threw a\\u00a0sulphureous\\u00a0lustre over all. His long improvised dirges will ring forever in my ears. Among other things, I hold painfully in mind a certain singular perversion and amplification of the wild air of the last waltz of Von Weber. From the paintings over which his elaborate fancy brooded, and which grew, touch by touch, into vaguenesses at which I shuddered the more thrillingly, because I shuddered knowing not why; \\u2013 from these paintings (vivid as their images now are before me) I would in vain endeavour to educe more than a small portion which should lie within the compass of merely written words. By the utter simplicity, by the nakedness of his designs, he arrested and overawed attention. If ever mortal painted an idea, that mortal was Roderick Usher. For me at least \\u2013 in the circumstances then surrounding me \\u2013 there arose out of the pure abstractions which the hypochondriac contrived to throw upon his canvas, an intensity of intolerable awe, no shadow of which felt I ever yet in the contemplation of the certainly glowing yet too concrete reveries of\\u00a0Fuseli.\\nOne of the\\u00a0phantasmagoric\\u00a0conceptions of my friend, partaking not so rigidly of the spirit of abstraction, may be shadowed forth, although feebly, in words. A small picture presented the interior of an immensely long and rectangular vault or tunnel, with low walls, smooth, white, and without interruption or device. Certain accessory points of the design served well to convey the idea that this excavation lay at an exceeding depth below the surface of the earth. No outlet was observed in any portion of its vast extent, and no torch, or other artificial source of light was discernible; yet a flood of intense rays rolled throughout, and bathed the whole in a ghastly and inappropriate splendour.\\nI have just spoken of that morbid condition of the auditory nerve which rendered all music intolerable to the sufferer, with the exception of certain effects of stringed instruments. It was, perhaps, the narrow limits to which he thus confined himself upon the guitar, which gave birth, in great measure, to the fantastic character of his performances. But the fervid facility of his impromptus could not be so accounted for. They must have been, and were, in the notes, as well as in the words of his wild fantasias (for he not unfrequently accompanied himself with rhymed verbal improvisations), the result of that intense mental collectedness and concentration to which I have previously alluded as observable only in particular moments of the highest artificial excitement. The words of one of these rhapsodies I have easily remembered. I was, perhaps, the more forcibly impressed with it, as he gave it, because, in the under or mystic current of its meaning, I fancied that I perceived, and for the first time, a full consciousness on the part of Usher, of the tottering of his lofty reason upon her throne. The verses, which were entitled \\u201cThe Haunted Palace,\\u201d ran very nearly, if not accurately, thus:\\nI.\\nIn the greenest of our valleys,\\nBy good angels tenanted,\\nOnce fair and stately palace \\u2013\\nRadiant palace \\u2013 reared its head.\\nIn the monarch Thought\\u2019s dominion \\u2013\\nIt stood there!\\nNever seraph spread a pinion\\nOver fabric half so fair.\\nII.\\n\\n\\n\\nBanners yellow, glorious, golden,\\nOn its roof did float and flow;\\n(This \\u2013 all this \\u2013 was in the olden\\nTime long ago)\\nAnd every gentle air that dallied,\\nIn that sweet day,\\nAlong the ramparts plumed and\\u00a0pallid,\\nA winged odour went away.\\nIII.\\nWanderers in that happy valley\\nThrough two luminous windows saw\\nSpirits moving musically\\nTo a lute\\u2019s well-tuned law,\\nRound about a throne, where sitting\\n(Porphyrogene!)\\nIn state his glory well befitting,\\nThe ruler of the realm was seen.\\nIV.\\nAnd all with pearl and ruby glowing\\nWas the fair palace door,\\nThrough which came flowing, flowing, flowing\\nAnd sparkling evermore,\\nA troop of Echoes whose sweet duty\\nWas but to sing,\\nIn voices of surpassing beauty,\\nThe wit and wisdom of their king.\\nV.\\nBut evil things, in robes of sorrow,\\nAssailed the monarch\\u2019s high estate;\\n(Ah, let us mourn, for never morrow\\nShall dawn upon him, desolate!)\\nAnd, round about his home, the glory\\nThat blushed and bloomed\\nIs but a dim-remembered story\\nOf the old time entombed.\\nVI.\\nAnd travellers now within that valley,\\nThrough the red-litten windows, see\\nVast forms that move fantastically\\nTo a discordant melody;\\nWhile, like a rapid ghastly river,\\nThrough the pale door,\\nA hideous throng rush out forever,\\nAnd laugh \\u2013 but smile no more.\\nI well remember that suggestions arising from this ballad led us into a train of thought wherein there became manifest an opinion of Usher\\u2019s which I mention not so much on account of its novelty, (for other men2 have thought thus,) as on account of the pertinacity with which he maintained it. This opinion, in its general form, was that of the sentience of all vegetable things. But, in his disordered fancy, the idea had assumed a more daring character, and trespassed, under certain conditions, upon the kingdom of inorganization. I lack words to express the full extent, or the earnest abandon of his persuasion. The belief, however, was connected (as I have previously hinted) with the gray stones of the home of his forefathers. The conditions of the sentience had been here, he imagined, fulfilled in the method of collocation of these stones \\u2013 in the order of their arrangement, as well as in that of the many fungi which overspread them, and of the decayed trees which stood around \\u2013 above all, in the long undisturbed endurance of this arrangement, and in its reduplication in the still waters of the tarn. Its evidence \\u2013 the evidence of the sentience \\u2013 was to be seen, he said, (and I here started as he spoke,) in the gradual yet certain condensation of an atmosphere of their own about the waters and the walls. The result was discoverable, he added, in that silent, yet importunate and terrible influence which for centuries had moulded the destinies of his family, and which made him what I now saw him \\u2013 what he was. Such opinions need no comment, and I will make none.\\nOur books \\u2013 the books which, for years, had formed no small portion of the mental existence of the invalid \\u2013 were, as might be supposed, in strict keeping with this character of\\u00a0phantasm. We pored together over such works as the\\u00a0Ververt et Chartreuse\\u00a0of Gresset; the\\u00a0Belphegor\\u00a0of\\u00a0Machiavelli; the Heaven and Hell of\\u00a0Swedenborg; the Subterranean Voyage of\\u00a0Nicholas Klimm\\u00a0by Holberg; the\\u00a0Chiromancy of Robert Flud, of Jean D\\u2019Indagin\\u00e9, and of De la Chambre; the Journey into the\\u00a0Blue Distance of Tieck; and the City of the Sun of\\u00a0Campanella. One favourite volume was a small octavo edition of the\\u00a0Directorium Inquisitorum, by the Dominican Eymeric de Gironne; and there were passages in Pomponius Mela, about the old African Satyrs and \\u00c6gipans, over which Usher would sit dreaming for hours. His chief delight, however, was found in the perusal of an exceedingly rare and curious book in quarto Gothic \\u2013 the manual of a forgotten church \\u2013 the Vigilae Mortuorum secundum Chorum Ecclesiae Maguntinae.\\nI could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work, and of its probable influence upon the hypochondriac, when, one evening, having informed me abruptly that the lady Madeline was no more, he stated his intention of preserving her corpse for a\\u00a0fortnight, (previously to its final interment,) in one of the numerous vaults within the main walls of the building. The worldly reason, however, assigned for this singular proceeding, was one which I did not feel at liberty to dispute. The brother had been led to his resolution (so he told me) by consideration of the unusual character of the malady of the deceased, of certain obtrusive and eager inquiries on the part of her medical men, and of the remote and exposed situation of the burial-ground of the family. I will not deny that when I called to mind the sinister countenance of the person whom I met upon the stair case, on the day of my arrival at the house, I had no desire to oppose what I regarded as at best but a harmless, and by no means an unnatural, precaution.\\nAt the request of Usher, I personally aided him in the arrangements for the temporary entombment. The body having been encoffined, we two alone bore it to its rest. The vault in which we placed it (and which had been so long unopened that our torches, half smothered in its oppressive atmosphere, gave us little opportunity for investigation) was small, damp, and entirely without means of admission for light; lying, at great depth, immediately beneath that portion of the building in which was my own sleeping apartment. It had been used, apparently, in remote feudal times, for the worst purposes of a\\u00a0donjon-keep, and, in later days, as a place of deposit for powder, or some other highly combustible substance, as a portion of its floor, and the whole interior of a long archway through which we reached it, were carefully sheathed with copper. The door, of massive iron, had been, also, similarly protected. Its immense weight caused an unusually sharp grating sound, as it moved upon its hinges.\\nHaving deposited our mournful burden upon tressels within this region of horror, we partially turned aside the yet unscrewed lid of the coffin, and looked upon the face of the tenant. A striking similitude between the brother and sister now first arrested my attention; and Usher, divining, perhaps, my thoughts, murmured out some few words from which I learned that the deceased and himself had been twins, and that sympathies of a scarcely intelligible nature had always existed between them. Our glances, however, rested not long upon the dead \\u2013 for we could not regard her unawed. The disease which had thus entombed the lady in the maturity of youth, had left, as usual in all maladies of a strictly\\u00a0cataleptical\\u00a0character, the mockery of a faint blush upon the bosom and the face, and that suspiciously lingering smile upon the lip which is so terrible in death. We replaced and screwed down the lid, and, having secured the door of iron, made our way, with toll, into the scarcely less gloomy apartments of the upper portion of the house.\\nAnd now, some days of bitter grief having elapsed, an observable change came over the features of the mental disorder of my friend. His ordinary manner had vanished. His ordinary occupations were neglected or forgotten. He roamed from chamber to chamber with hurried, unequal, and objectless step. The pallor of his countenance had assumed, if possible, a more ghastly hue \\u2013 but the luminousness of his eye had utterly gone out. The once occasional huskiness of his tone was heard no more; and a tremulous quaver, as if of extreme terror, habitually characterized his utterance. There were times, indeed, when I thought his unceasingly agitated mind was labouring with some oppressive secret, to divulge which he struggled for the necessary courage. At times, again, I was obliged to resolve all into the mere inexplicable vagaries of madness, for I beheld him gazing upon vacancy for long hours, in an attitude of the profoundest attention, as if listening to some imaginary sound. It was no wonder that his condition terrified-that it infected me. I felt creeping upon me, by slow yet certain degrees, the wild influences of his own fantastic yet impressive superstitions.\\nIt was, especially, upon retiring to bed late in the night of the seventh or eighth day after the placing of the lady Madeline within the donjon, that I experienced the full power of such feelings. Sleep came not near my couch \\u2013 while the hours waned and waned away. I struggled to reason off the nervousness which had dominion over me. I endeavoured to believe that much, if not all of what I felt, was due to the bewildering influence of the gloomy furniture of the room \\u2013 of the dark and tattered draperies, which, tortured into motion by the breath of a rising\\u00a0tempest, swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls, and rustled uneasily about the decorations of the bed. But my efforts were fruitless. An irrepressible tremour gradually pervaded my frame; and, at length, there sat upon my very heart an\\u00a0incubus\\u00a0of utterly causeless alarm. Shaking this off with a gasp and a struggle, I uplifted myself upon the pillows, and, peering earnestly within the intense darkness of the chamber, hearkened \\u2013 I know not why, except that an instinctive spirit prompted me \\u2013 to certain low and indefinite sounds which came, through the pauses of the storm, at long intervals, I knew not whence. Overpowered by an intense sentiment of horror, unaccountable yet unendurable, I threw on my clothes with haste (for I felt that I should sleep no more during the night), and endeavoured to arouse myself from the pitiable condition into which I had fallen, by pacing rapidly to and fro through the apartment.\\nI had taken but few turns in this manner, when a light step on an adjoining staircase arrested my attention. I presently recognised it as that of Usher. In an instant afterward he rapped, with a gentle touch, at my door, and entered, bearing a lamp. His countenance was, as usual,\\u00a0cadaverously\\u00a0wan \\u2013 but, moreover, there was a species of mad hilarity in his eyes \\u2013 an evidently restrained hysteria in his whole demeanour. His air appalled me \\u2013 but anything was preferable to the solitude which I had so long endured, and I even welcomed his presence as a relief.\\n\\u201cAnd you have not seen it?\\u201d he said abruptly, after having stared about him for some moments in silence \\u2013 \\u201cyou have not then seen it? \\u2013 but, stay! you shall.\\u201d Thus speaking, and having carefully shaded his lamp, he hurried to one of the casements, and threw it freely open to the storm.\\nThe impetuous fury of the entering gust nearly lifted us from our feet. It was, indeed, a\\u00a0tempestuous\\u00a0yet sternly beautiful night, and one wildly singular in its terror and its beauty. A whirlwind had apparently collected its force in our vicinity; for there were frequent and violent alterations in the direction of the wind; and the exceeding density of the clouds (which hung so low as to press upon the turrets of the house) did not prevent our perceiving the life-like velocity with which they flew careering from all points against each other, without passing away into the distance. I say that even their exceeding density did not prevent our perceiving this \\u2013 yet we had no glimpse of the moon or stars \\u2013 nor was there any flashing forth of the lightning. But the under surfaces of the huge masses of agitated vapour, as well as all terrestrial objects immediately around us, were glowing in the unnatural light of a faintly luminous and distinctly visible gaseous exhalation which hung about and enshrouded the mansion.\\n\\u201cYou must not \\u2013 you shall not behold this!\\u201d said I, shudderingly, to Usher, as I led him, with a gentle violence, from the window to a seat. \\u201cThese appearances, which bewilder you, are merely electrical phenomena not uncommon \\u2013 or it may be that they have their ghastly origin in the rank miasma of the\\u00a0tarn. Let us close this casement; \\u2013 the air is chilling and dangerous to your frame. Here is one of your favourite romances. I will read, and you shall listen; \\u2013 and so we will pass away this terrible night together.\\u201d\\nThe antique volume which I had taken up was the Mad Trist of Sir Launcelot Canning; but I had called it a favourite of Usher\\u2019s more in sad jest than in earnest; for, in truth, there is little in its uncouth and unimaginative prolixity which could have had interest for the lofty and spiritual ideality of my friend. It was, however, the only book immediately at hand; and I indulged a vague hope that the excitement which now agitated the hypochondriac, might find relief (for the history of mental disorder is full of similar anomalies) even in the extremeness of the folly which I should read. Could I have judged, indeed, by the wild over-strained air of vivacity with which he hearkened, or apparently hearkened, to the words of the tale, I might well have congratulated myself upon the success of my design.\\nI had arrived at that well-known portion of the story where Ethelred, the hero of the Trist, having sought in vain for peaceable admission into the dwelling of the hermit, proceeds to make good an entrance by force. Here, it will be remembered, the words of the narrative run thus:\\n\\u201cAnd Ethelred, who was by nature of a doughty heart, and who was now mighty withal, on account of the powerfulness of the wine which he had drunken, waited no longer to hold parley with the hermit, who,\\u00a0in sooth, was of an obstinate and maliceful turn, but, feeling the rain upon his shoulders, and fearing the rising of the\\u00a0tempest, uplifted his mace outright, and, with blows, made quickly room in the plankings of the door for his gauntleted hand; and now pulling there-with sturdily, he so cracked, and ripped, and tore all asunder, that the noise of the dry and hollow-sounding wood alarumed and reverberated throughout the forest.\\nAt the termination of this sentence I started, and for a moment, paused; for it appeared to me (although I at once concluded that my excited fancy had deceived me) \\u2013 it appeared to me that, from some very remote portion of the mansion, there came, indistinctly, to my ears, what might have been, in its exact similarity of character, the echo (but a stifled and dull one certainly) of the very cracking and ripping sound which Sir Launcelot had so particularly described. It was, beyond doubt, the coincidence alone which had arrested my attention; for, amid the rattling of the sashes of the casements, and the ordinary commingled noises of the still increasing storm, the sound, in itself, had nothing, surely, which should have interested or disturbed me. I continued the story:\\n\\u201cBut the good champion Ethelred, now entering within the door, was sore enraged and amazed to perceive no signal of the maliceful hermit; but, in the stead thereof, a dragon of a scaly and\\u00a0prodigious\\u00a0demeanour, and of a fiery tongue, which\\u00a0sate\\u00a0in guard before a palace of gold, with a floor of silver; and upon the wall there hung a shield of shining brass with this legend enwritten \\u2013\\n\\n\\n\\nWho entereth herein, a conqueror hath bin;\\nWho slayeth the dragon, the shield he shall win;\\nand Ethelred uplifted his mace, and struck upon the head of the dragon, which fell before him, and gave up his pesty breath, with a shriek so horrid and harsh, and withal so piercing, that Ethelred had fain to close his ears with his hands against the dreadful noise of it, the like whereof was never before heard.\\u201d\\nHere again I paused abruptly, and now with a feeling of wild amazement \\u2013 for there could be no doubt whatever that, in this instance, I did actually hear (although from what direction it proceeded I found it impossible to say) a low and apparently distant, but harsh, protracted, and most unusual screaming or grating sound \\u2013 the exact counterpart of what my fancy had already conjured up for the dragon\\u2019s unnatural shriek as described by the romancer.\\nOppressed, as I certainly was, upon the occurrence of the second and most extraordinary coincidence, by a thousand conflicting sensations, in which wonder and extreme terror were predominant, I still retained sufficient presence of mind to avoid exciting, by any observation, the sensitive nervousness of my companion. I was by no means certain that he had noticed the sounds in question; although, assuredly, a strange alteration had, during the last few minutes, taken place in his demeanour. From a position fronting my own, he had gradually brought round his chair, so as to sit with his face to the door of the chamber; and thus I could but partially perceive his features, although I saw that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring inaudibly. His head had dropped upon his breast \\u2013 yet I knew that he was not asleep, from the wide and rigid opening of the eye as I caught a glance of it in profile. The motion of his body, too, was at variance with this idea \\u2013 for he rocked from side to side with a gentle yet constant and uniform sway. Having rapidly taken notice of all this, I resumed the narrative of Sir Launcelot, which thus proceeded:\\n\\u201cAnd now, the champion, having escaped from the terrible fury of the dragon, bethinking himself of the brazen shield, and of the breaking up of the enchantment which was upon it, removed the carcass from out of the way before him, and approached valorously over the silver pavement of the castle to where the shield was upon the wall; which\\u00a0in sooth\\u00a0tarried not for his full coming, but fell down at his feet upon the silver floor, with a mighty great and terrible ringing sound.\\u201d\\nNo sooner had these syllables passed my lips, than \\u2013 as if a shield of brass had indeed, at the moment, fallen heavily upon a floor of silver, became aware of a distinct, hollow, metallic, and clangorous, yet apparently muffled reverberation. Completely unnerved, I leaped to my feet; but the measured rocking movement of Usher was undisturbed. I rushed to the chair in which he sat. His eyes were bent fixedly before him, and throughout his whole countenance there reigned a stony rigidity. But, as I placed my hand upon his shoulder, there came a strong shudder over his whole person; a sickly smile quivered about his lips; and I saw that he spoke in a low, hurried, and gibbering murmur, as if unconscious of my presence. Bending closely over him, I at length drank in the hideous import of his words.\\n\\u201cNot hear it? \\u2013 yes, I hear it, and have heard it. Long \\u2013 long \\u2013 long \\u2013 many minutes, many hours, many days, have I heard it \\u2013 yet I dared not \\u2013 oh, pity me, miserable wretch that I am! \\u2013 I dared not \\u2013 I dared not speak! We have put her living in the tomb! Said I not that my senses were\\u00a0acute? I now tell you that I heard her first feeble movements in the hollow coffin. I heard them \\u2013 many, many days ago \\u2013 yet I dared not \\u2013 I dared not speak! And now \\u2013 to-night \\u2013 Ethelred \\u2013 ha! ha! \\u2013 the breaking of the hermit\\u2019s door, and the death-cry of the dragon, and the clangour of the shield! \\u2013 say, rather, the rending of her coffin, and the grating of the iron hinges of her prison, and her struggles within the coppered archway of the vault! Oh whither shall I fly? Will she not be here anon? Is she not hurrying to upbraid me for my haste? Have I not heard her footstep on the stair? Do I not distinguish that heavy and horrible beating of her heart? MADMAN!\\u201d here he sprang furiously to his feet, and shrieked out his syllables, as if in the effort he were giving up his soul \\u2013 \\u201cMADMAN! I TELL YOU THAT SHE NOW STANDS WITHOUT THE DOOR!\\u201d\\nAs if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there had been found the potency of a spell \\u2013 the huge antique panels to which the speaker pointed, threw slowly back, upon the instant, ponderous and ebony jaws. It was the work of the rushing gust \\u2013 but then without those doors there DID stand the lofty and enshrouded figure of the lady Madeline of Usher. There was blood upon her white robes, and the evidence of some bitter struggle upon every portion of her emaciated frame. For a moment she remained trembling and reeling to and fro upon the threshold, then, with a low moaning cry, fell heavily inward upon the person of her brother, and in her violent and now final death-agonies, bore him to the floor a corpse, and a victim to the terrors he had anticipated.\\nFrom that chamber, and from that mansion, I fled\\u00a0aghast. The storm was still abroad in all its wrath as I found myself crossing the old causeway. Suddenly there shot along the path a wild light, and I turned to see whence a gleam so unusual could have issued; for the vast house and its shadows were alone behind me. The radiance was that of the full, setting, and blood-red moon which now shone vividly through that once barely-discernible fissure of which I have before spoken as extending from the roof of the building, in a zig-zag direction, to the base. While I gazed, this fissure rapidly widened \\u2013 there came a fierce breath of the whirlwind \\u2013 the entire orb of the satellite burst at once upon my sight \\u2013 my brain reeled as I saw the mighty walls rushing asunder \\u2013 there was a long tumultuous shouting sound like the voice of a thousand waters \\u2013 and the deep and dank\\u00a0tarn\\u00a0at my feet closed sullenly and silently over the fragments of the \\u201cHOUSE OF USHER.\\u201d\\n* * *\\nNOTES\\n1. The epigraph at the beginning of Edgar Allan Poe\\u2019s \\u201cThe Fall of the House of Usher,\\u201d taken from a poem by Pierre Jean de B\\u00e9ranger, serves as a metaphorical preface to the story\\u2019s themes and atmosphere. The lines, \\u201cSon c\\u0153ur est un luth suspendu; Sit\\u00f4t qu\\u2019on le touche il r\\u00e9sonne,\\u201d translate to \\u201cHis heart is a lute suspended; As soon as one touches it, it resonates.\\u201d\\nThis epigraph suggests a sensitivity to external influences, symbolizing the delicate and responsive nature of the human psyche. In the context of the story, it foreshadows the intense emotional and psychological states of the characters, particularly Roderick Usher, whose mental and physical condition is highly susceptible to his environment. The Usher family home, a Gothic mansion that is almost a character in its own right, acts as an external embodiment of Roderick\\u2019s internal state, with its decaying structure mirroring his deteriorating mind. The epigraph hints at the central themes of the story: the interplay between the physical and psychological, the impact of the past on the present, and the idea that both the human mind and the environments we inhabit are easily affected by stimuli, capable of producing profound reactions to seemingly minor provocations. It sets the stage for a tale where atmosphere, setting, and emotion resonate together, much like the strings of a lute respond to a touch.\\n2. Watson, Dr. Percival, Spallanzani, and especially the Bishop of Landaff.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\",\n          \"\\n \\nIn the vast realm of science fiction literature, Frank Herbert\\u2019s \\u201cDune\\u201d stands as a monumental work that goes beyond mere interstellar adventures. Beneath the surface of Arrakis\\u2019 golden dunes and political intrigue lies a profound environmental allegory that resonates with ecological themes. Let\\u2019s delve into the intricacies of Herbert\\u2019s eco-conscious masterpiece and explore how Arrakis becomes a compelling allegory for environmental challenges.\\nThe Spice Melange as a Finite Resource: At the heart of Arrakis\\u2019 environmental allegory is the spice melange, a substance that grants heightened awareness and the ability to fold space. Analogous to Earth\\u2019s limited resources, the spice serves as a metaphor for humanity\\u2019s reliance on finite commodities. Herbert ingeniously uses the spice to explore the consequences of unchecked exploitation and the ethical dilemmas surrounding resource management.\\nThe Fremen\\u2019s Water Discipline: Water, the most precious resource on Arrakis, takes center stage in the Fremen\\u2019s daily lives. Herbert mirrors our planet\\u2019s struggle with water scarcity through the Fremen\\u2019s meticulous water discipline. The stillsuits, worn by the Fremen to reclaim and recycle bodily fluids, echo our real-world need for sustainable water practices in the face of a changing climate.\\nSandworms and Ecological Balance: The colossal sandworms, guardians of the spice, symbolize the delicate ecological balance on Arrakis. Herbert prompts readers to reflect on the consequences of disrupting ecosystems, drawing parallels to Earth\\u2019s ecosystems where the extinction of a single species can have cascading effects. The sandworms, majestic and mysterious, embody the interconnectedness of life on Arrakis.\\nNoble Houses and Resource Exploitation: Arrakis becomes a microcosm of our own planet\\u2019s struggles with resource exploitation. The noble houses, eager to control the spice trade, mirror corporations and nations exploiting Earth\\u2019s resources for economic gain. Herbert\\u2019s narrative invites readers to question the ethics of resource extraction and the long-term consequences of prioritizing profit over planetary well-being.\\nHerbert\\u2019s Visionary Environmentalism: Long before environmental consciousness became a mainstream concern, Herbert was weaving a narrative that anticipated the ecological challenges of the future. \\u201cDune\\u201d serves as a cautionary tale, urging readers to consider the impact of their actions on the environment. Herbert\\u2019s visionary environmentalism remains relevant as societies grapple with climate change and the consequences of unfettered industrialization.\\nAdaptations and Contemporary Relevance: As \\u201cDune\\u201d makes its way to the big screen, filmmakers face the challenge of translating Herbert\\u2019s environmental allegory into a visual medium. Each adaptation provides an opportunity to revisit Arrakis and its ecological message, prompting audiences to reflect on the environmental challenges confronting our own world.\\nConclusion: \\u201cDune\\u201d as an Ecological Parable: In the sands of Arrakis, Frank Herbert crafted more than a science fiction epic; he created an allegory for our planet\\u2019s environmental struggles. \\u201cDune\\u201d challenges readers to confront the consequences of environmental exploitation and advocates for a mindful approach to resource management. As we navigate the intricate political landscape of Arrakis, Herbert\\u2019s environmental allegory invites us to consider the impact of our choices on Earth, making \\u201cDune\\u201d not just a classic of science fiction but a timeless reflection on our planet\\u2019s ecological destiny.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\",\n          \"\\n \\nVyvyan Holland, in his introduction to the 1966 edition of Oscar Wilde\\u2019s works, provides an insightful overview of his father\\u2019s lineage, life, and literary career. He recounts the family\\u2019s Dutch origin, Oscar\\u2019s upbringing and education, his rise in London society, and his contributions to literature, from poetry and essays to renowned plays like The Importance of Being Earnest. Holland also touches on the darker aspects of Wilde\\u2019s life, including his trial, imprisonment, and posthumous conversion to Catholicism, ultimately painting a complex and enduring portrait of one of the most celebrated figures in literary history.\\n* * *\\nINTRODUCTION TO THE 1966 EDITION\\nby Vyvyan Holland\\nOscar Wilde\\u2019s family is Dutch in origin. The first Wilde to settle in Ireland was a certain Colonel de Wilde, the son of an artist, examples of whose work hang in the Art Gallery at The Hague; he was a soldier of fortune who was granted lands in Connaught at the end of the seventeenth century for his services to King William III of England. He is said to have repented his adherence to the English king and to have become \\u2018more Irish than the Irish\\u2019. From that time the family were land agents and doctors.\\nMy father\\u2019s parents were both distinguished in their own way. Sir William Wilde was the foremost eye and ear specialist of his time, and a physician of international repute. He invented the operation for cataract and performed it on King Oscar of Sweden, for which he received the Order of the Polar Star. His mother, Lady Wilde, born Jane Francesca Elgee, was a staunch Irish Nationalist, who wrote fierce poems and articles in the Irish Nationalist newspaper The Nation, under the name of \\u2018Speranza\\u2019, a name she had adopted from her motto \\u2018Fidanza, Constanza, Speranza\\u2019 \\u2013 Faith, Constancy, Hope. Lady Wilde had three children, William, Oscar and Isola, who died when she was ten, to Oscar\\u2019s lasting grief. Oscar Wilde was born on 16 October 1854, and was given the names Oscar Fingal O\\u2019Flahertie Wills Wilde.\\nHis education began at Portora Royal School In Enniskillen, from which he obtained a scholarship to Trinity College, Dublin, where he won the Berkeley Gold Medal for Greek. From there he received a demyship to Magdalen College, Oxford. While at Oxford he came under the Influence of John Ruskin and Walter Pater. Pater preached the love of Art for Art\\u2019s sake, and Oscar Wilde, going one step further, set out to idolise beauty for beauty\\u2019s sake and filled his rooms looking over the Cherwell with blue china and reproductions of paintings by Rossetti and Burne-Jones. Aestheticism was the key-note of his creed and he declared that beauty was the ideal after which everyone should strive.\\nMy father\\u2019s life at Oxford, one gathers from his letters, was a joyous one. He entered whole-heartedly into the undergraduate life of the University and distinguished himself by winning the Newdigate Prize for English verse and getting a double first in Classics. Upon this note he came to London in 1879 with the remains of a small patrimony and started to make his living by his pen. True to his doctrine of beauty he established himself as the \\u2018Apostle of Aestheticism\\u2019 and drew attention to himself by the eccentricity of his dress. It must be remembered that at this period the clothing of the British upper middle classes was rigidly conventional, and the sight of him in the evening in a velvet coat edged with braid, knee-breeches, black silk stockings, a soft loose shirt with a wide turn-down collar and a large flowing tie, was bound to arouse indignant curiosity.\\nAt the same time he was writing poems, and in 1880 he also wrote Vera, a rather immature play, which ran for one week in New York in 1883 and never reached the boards in London. In 1881 his collected poems were published, and in 1882, being short of money, he was persuaded to go on a lecture tour to America. This proved to be a brilliant success and he returned to England in 1883, covered, if not with glory, at least with considerable notoriety.\\nOn his return to Europe, he retired to Paris to finish another play, The Duchess of Padua, for the American actress Mary Anderson; but when she received the play, she turned it down flatly. This was really a disaster for Oscar Wilde, and he returned to England and went on a series of lecture tours in the provinces. However, this nomadic life soon palled and he returned to London where, in 1884, he married Constance Mary, daughter of a distinguished Irish barrister, Horace Lloyd, Q.C. Oscar was romantically in love with his beautiful young wife and for some years he was ideally happy. He had two sons by his wife \\u2013 Cyril, born in 1885, and myself in 1886.\\nOddly enough, although his literary activities had been almost entirely confined to writing poetry until his marriage, he now turned largely to prose and, with the exception of The Sphinx, the idea of which had occurred to him much earlier, he wrote few poems until after his imprisonment, when he wrote The Ballad of Reading Gaol. Boris Brasol, who wrote one of the only two carefully considered lives of my father, sums up his poetic period as follows:\\n\\u2018He began his literary career as a composer of sonorous and pleasing verses in which, however, as he himself admitted, \\u2018there was more rhyme than reason\\u2019; yet as he grew older, he seemed to have lost all taste for poetry, and though there Is nothing that would justify the contention that he ever regarded his early poems as callow productions, the fact remains that upon reaching maturity he took no further interest in that delightful occupation which Browning aptly called \\u201cthe unlocking of hearts with sonnet keys\\u201d.\\u2019\\nUpon what, then, does his reputation as an author rest? His early poems were mostly lyrical, and certain of them will undoubtedly pass the test of time. His true literary life was spread over seven years only, from 1888 until 1894. In 1887 he had become editor of Woman\\u2019s World in which capacity he continued until 1889 when he resigned. He had gathered a reputation for eccentricity and, still more, as a conversationalist. There are few people alive now who remember his conversation, but when in 1954 a plaque was unveiled by Sir Compton Mackenzie on the house in Tite Street where my family lived for eleven years, he read the following message from Sir Max Beerbohm (the Incomparable Max!), who felt too frail to undertake the journey to London to be present:\\n\\u2018I have had the privilege of listening to many masters of table talk \\u2013 Meredith and Swinburne, Edmund Gosse and Henry James, Augustine Birrell and Arthur Balfour, Gilbert Chesterton and Desmond MacCarthy and Hilaire Belloc \\u2013 all of them splendid in their own way. But Oscar was the greatest of them all \\u2013 the most spontaneous and yet the most polished, the most soothing and yet the most surprising\\u2026Nobody was willing to interrupt the music of so magnificent a virtuoso. To have heard him consoled me for not having heard Dr Johnson or Edmund Burke, Lord Brougham or Sidney Smith.\\u2019\\nWinston Churchill was once asked whom he would like to meet and talk with in after life, and he replied, without hesitation: \\u2018Oscar Wilde.\\u2019\\nWilde\\u2019s first memorable work was The Happy Prince, which appeared in 1888. The stories in The Happy Prince are really poems in prose more than fairytales for children; and yet the remarkable thing is that they appeal equally to children and adults.\\nIn 1891 he produced a small volume ot tour stories which he had written some time previously. The book was called Lord Arthur Savile\\u2019s Crime and Other Stories, the other three tales being The Canterville Ghost\\u2019, The Sphinx without a Secret\\u2019 and \\u2018The Model Millionaire\\u2019. The first two of these stories have been dramatised and their substance has been copied on several occasions; they possess the light-hearted gaiety and insouciance that find their fullest expression in The Importance of Being Earnest, and show the buoyancy of my father\\u2019s spirit at that time.\\nA House of Pomegranates, my father\\u2019s other book of short stories \\u2013 one can hardly call them fairy tales \\u2013 appeared with illustrations by Charles Shannon, R.A. in the same year. This book completely puzzled the critics, who thought that the stories were meant for children and protested, quite rightly, that no child could understand them. This was followed by The Sphinx, which really dated from his Oxford days, and upon which he had worked at intervals ever since. The critics were again confused by the poem, which was really nothing more than an experiment with words. He revelled in finding rhymes for words such as hieroglyph and catafalque, which he rhymed with hippogriff and Amenalk.\\nIn 1891, too, Oscar Wilde\\u2019s only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, appeared in book form, enlarged from the original which had been already published in Lippincott\\u2019s Magazine. The publication of this work was greeted with a storm of protest by the critics. The English Press was almost unanimous in its condemnation of the book. The Idea of the book had first come to my father some years before. Hesketh Pearson tells the story of it in his Life of Oscar Wilde;\\u2019 In the year 1884 Wilde used to drop in at the studio of a painter, Basil Ward, one of whose sitters was a young man of exceptional beauty\\u2026When the portrait was done and the youth had gone, Wilde happened to say, \\u201cWhat a pity that such a glorious creature should ever grow old!\\u201d The artist agreed, adding, \\u201cHow delightful it would be if he could remain exactly as he is, while the portrait aged and withered in his stead!\\u201d Wilde expressed his obligation by calling the painter in his story Basil Hallward.\\u2019\\nBy far the most interesting and entertaining book of essays that Oscar Wilde wrote was Intentions, in which he really gave rein to his imagination. In my own opinion, it is the most absorbing of all his works. The Critic as Artist occupies considerably more than half of it; its sub-title \\u2018with some remarks upon the importance of doing nothing\\u2019 shows the curious charm the word \\u2018importance\\u2019 had for him; it occurs in the titles of two of his plays, and is constantly cropping up in his essays. It is almost as though the word held a strange sonorousness for him and that he liked to roll it, if not round his tongue, then round his mind.\\nBut the most interesting essay in the book is The Decay of Lying. The essay is in the form of a dialogue, the dominant theme being the vast superiority of Art over Nature, leading to the conclusion that Nature follows Art.\\nOscar Wilde now entered into his final stage, the one for which he was destined, that of a dramatist. In 1891 he wrote Lady Windermere\\u2019s Fan, which he described as \\u2018one of those modern drawing-room plays with pink lampshades\\u2019. It was produced at the St James\\u2019s Theatre in February, 1892 by George Alexander. There were loud cries of \\u2018Author!\\u2019 at the end of the play and Wilde came onto the stage with a cigarette in his gloved hand and said: \\u2018Ladies and Gentlemen. I have enjoyed this evening immensely. The actors have given us a charming rendering of a delightful play, and your appreciation has been most intelligent. I congratulate you on the great success of your performance which persuades me that you think almost as highly of the play as I do.\\u2019\\nWhen Wilde had finished Lady Windermere\\u2019s Fan he retired to Paris and wrote his Biblical play Salome in French, dedicated to Pierre Louys who made certain corrections in the French, but did not otherwise interfere with it. Sarah Bernhardt was immensely attracted to this play, and she put it into rehearsal at the Palace Theatre in London, with herself in the title-role. However, the Lord Chamberlain refused to grant it a licence, on the ground that no play which contained Biblical characters was allowed to be performed on the English stage. This so annoyed Wilde that he announced his intentions of renouncing his British nationality and becoming a Frenchman, there being no such restrictions in France. As matters turned out, it is a pity that he did not carry out his threat.\\nIn the summer of 1892 he wrote A Woman of No Importance, which was produced with immediate success by Herbert Beerbohm Tree at the Haymarket in 1893. Once again the audience rose to its feet and called for the author. This time remembering the bad impression he had made on the first night of Lady Windermere\\u2019s Fan, he got up in the box in which he was sitting and announced: \\u2018Ladies and Gentlemen, I regret to inform you that Mr Oscar Wilde is not in the house.\\u2019\\nOn 3 January 1895, Oscar Wilde\\u2019s third important play An Ideal Husband was produced by Lewis Waller. The Prince of Wales was present at the first night. It was almost unprecedented for Royalty to be present at a first night, and it seemed now that Wilde\\u2019s future was assured. George Bernard Shaw\\u2019s comment on the play is worth repeating: \\u2018Mr Oscar Wilde\\u2019s new play at the Haymarket is a dangerous subject, because he has the property of making his critics dull\\u2026He plays with everything; with wit, with philosophy, with drama, with actors and audience, with the whole theatre.\\u2019\\nAnd so we come to Oscar Wilde\\u2019s last, and his most brilliant play, The Importance of Being Earnest. Wilde originally wrote the play in four acts, as he had written his other three major plays. He submitted it in this form to George Alexander who, with the object of making room for a \\u2018curtain raiser\\u2019, as was usual in those days, asked Wilde to cut it to three acts. When, four years later, Leonard Smithers published the play in book form, it was this three-act version that he had printed, and each subsequent edition has followed this pattern. Why this has been so is not clear, but the play as written by Oscar Wilde, with two extra characters in it, is the play as given in this volume. As Mr Philip Drake, who is responsible for this edition of Wilde\\u2019s works, remarked, it seems a pity that George Alexander should have a permanent influence on the play.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Importance of Being Earnestwas produced at the St James\\u2019s Theatre on 14 February 1895. Wilde had now reached the pinnacle of his success. Two plays of his were drawing crowded audiences in the West End, and actormanagers were falling over one another to beg him to write for them. Then the Marquess of Queensberry, with the object of attacking his son, Lord Alfred Douglas, because of his friendship with Wilde, launched a campaign of ungovernable fury on Wilde. The story has been told often enough; Alfred Douglas, whose only object was to see his father in the dock, persuaded Oscar Wilde to bring a prosecution for criminal libel against him. Lord Queensberry was triumphantly acquitted and his place in the dock was taken by Oscar Wilde, who was sentenced to two years imprisonment.\\nWhile in prison, Wilde wrote the letter to Lord Alfred Douglas, part of which was published in 1905 by Robert Ross, under the title of De Profundis. In a letter to Robert Ross he wrote: \\u2018This is indeed an Encyclical letter, and as the Bulls of the Holy Father are named from their opening words, it may be spoken of as Epistola: in Carcere el Vinculis.\\u2019 The manuscript was not revised by Wilde, although he intended to do this, as is shown by the letter he wrote to Robert Ross: \\u2018As soon as you have read it, I want you to have it copied for me. As regards the method of copying, I wish the copy to be done on good paper and a wide rubricated margin should be left for corrections.\\u2019 A copy of De Profundis was made and sent to Alfred Douglas; but after reading the first few pages, he destroyed it, probably thinking, rather naively, that there was no other copy in existence. Douglas strenuously denied ever having received the letter, and he could not go back on this without contradicting himself.\\nAfter my father\\u2019s death in 1900, Alfred Douglas tried to get hold of the manuscript, but Robert Ross settled the matter by sealing it up and presenting it to the British Museum, with the proviso that it should remain sealed for sixty years, that is to say until 1960, at the end of which time it might safely be presumed that everyone mentioned in it would be dead.\\nThe copying was done hastily and without much care, because the version printed in 1949 varied in several particulars from the original manuscript, although, of course, the substance was the same. The version here printed has been carefully compared with the original and is exactly as Wilde wrote it.\\nThe Portrait of Mr. W. H. was first published as an article of 12,000 words in Blackwood\\u2019s Magazine for July, 1889. Oscar Wilde became more and more obsessed with the idea contained in the article and during the next four years he re-wrote the story and added to it, bringing the total up to 25,000 words. The manuscript disappeared at the time of the sale of my father\\u2019s effects at Tite Street, together with others, and did not re-appear until the year 1920 in America, where it was published in a limited edition by Mitchell Kennerley. The expanded version is printed in this edition.\\nThe only work that my father wrote after 1897 was the poem The Ballad of Reading Gaol, which he wrote at Berneval, so that Douglas\\u2019s claim to have had a large share in writing it may be ignored, as he and Wilde did not meet again until later.\\nAll his life, my father had an intense leaning towards religious mysticism and was strongly attracted to the Catholic Church, into which he was received on his death bed in 1900. His remains now lie in the French National Cemetery of Pere Lachaise.\\nSOURCE: Complete Works of Oscar Wilde, with an introduction by Vyvyan Holland, Collins, 1966\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"full_name\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"EDGAR \",\n          \"VYVYAN HOLLAND\",\n          \"HENRY DAVID\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"polarity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.0661302833744263,\n        \"min\": 0.037532171063277005,\n        \"max\": 0.2080952380952381,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.037532171063277005,\n          0.2080952380952381,\n          0.17556973615678065\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subjectivity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.041643130499489645,\n        \"min\": 0.428145227788085,\n        \"max\": 0.534657540421733,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.5177623835457936,\n          0.5278869047619049,\n          0.45590927740725323\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

              "[['\\n \\nIn Edgar Allan Poe’s The Fall of the House of Usher, the narrator describes a haunting visit to the eerie and decaying Usher mansion, where he encounters his childhood friend Roderick Usher, who suffers from acute anxiety and a morbid sensitivity to sensory stimuli. Roderick’s twin sister, Madeline, is gravely ill with a mysterious condition that leaves her cataleptic. The narrative unfolds in a gloomy atmosphere, filled with foreboding and supernatural elements, as the narrator witnesses the psychological disintegration of Roderick and the bizarre events leading up to Madeline’s death and terrifying return from the grave. The story culminates in the literal and metaphorical collapse of the Usher house into the dark tarn that mirrors it, symbolizing the end of the Usher family line and the inescapable doom of their ancient curse. Poe masterfully weaves themes of fear, isolation, and madness, creating a quintessential Gothic tale that explores the depths of human despair and the fragility of the psyche.\\n* * *\\nby Edgar Allan Poe\\nSon cœur est un luth suspendu;\\nSitôt qu’on le touche il résonne.\\n—De Béranger.1\\nDuring the whole of a dull, dark, and soundless day in the autumn of the year, when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens, I had been passing alone, on horseback, through a singularly dreary tract of country; and at length found myself, as the shades of the evening drew on, within view of the melancholy House of Usher. I know not how it was – but, with the first glimpse of the building, a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit. I say insufferable; for the feeling was unrelieved by any of that half-pleasurable, because poetic, sentiment, with which the mind usually receives even the sternest natural images of the desolate or terrible. I looked upon the scene before me – upon the mere house, and the simple landscape features of the domain – upon the bleak walls – upon the vacant eye-like windows – upon a few rank sedges – and upon a few white trunks of decayed trees – with an utter depression of soul which I can compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the after-dream of the reveller upon opium – the bitter lapse into everyday life – the hideous dropping off of the veil. There was an iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the heart – an unredeemed dreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could torture into aught of the sublime. What was it – I paused to think – what was it that so unnerved me in the contemplation of the House of Usher? It was a mystery all insoluble; nor could I grapple with the shadowy fancies that crowded upon me as I pondered. I was forced to fall back upon the unsatisfactory conclusion, that while, beyond doubt, there are combinations of very simple natural objects which have the power of thus affecting us, still the analysis of this power lies among considerations beyond our depth. It was possible, I reflected, that a mere different arrangement of the particulars of the scene, of the details of the picture, would be sufficient to modify, or perhaps to annihilate its capacity for sorrowful impression; and, acting upon this idea, I reined my horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in unruffled lustre by the dwelling, and gazed down – but with a shudder even more thrilling than before – upon the remodelled and inverted images of the gray sedge, and the ghastly tree-stems, and the vacant and eye-like windows.\\nNevertheless, in this mansion of gloom I now proposed to myself a\\xa0sojourn\\xa0of some weeks. Its proprietor, Roderick Usher, had been one of my boon companions in boyhood; but many years had elapsed since our last meeting. A letter, however, had lately reached me in a distant part of the country – a letter from him – which, in its wildly importunate nature, had admitted of no other than a personal reply. The MS. gave evidence of nervous agitation. The writer spoke of\\xa0acute\\xa0bodily illness – of a mental disorder which oppressed him – and of an earnest desire to see me, as his best, and indeed his only personal friend, with a view of attempting, by the cheerfulness of my society, some alleviation of his malady. It was the manner in which all this, and much more, was said – it the apparent heart that went with his request – which allowed me no room for hesitation; and I accordingly obeyed forthwith what I still considered a very ',\n",
              "  'singular summons.\\nAlthough, as boys, we had been even intimate associates, yet I really knew little of my friend. His reserve had been always excessive and habitual. I was aware, however, that his very ancient family had been noted, time out of mind, for a peculiar sensibility of temperament, displaying itself, through long ages, in many works of exalted art, and manifested, of late, in repeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive charity, as well as in a passionate devotion to the intricacies, perhaps even more than to the orthodox and easily recognisable beauties, of musical science. I had learned, too, the very remarkable fact, that the stem of the Usher race, all time-honoured as it was, had put forth, at no period, any enduring branch; in other words, that the entire family lay in the direct line of descent, and had always, with very trifling and very temporary variation, so lain. It was this deficiency, I considered, while running over in thought the perfect keeping of the character of the premises with the accredited character of the people, and while speculating upon the possible influence which the one, in the long lapse of centuries, might have exercised upon the other – it was this deficiency, perhaps, of collateral issue, and the consequent undeviating transmission, from sire to son, of the patrimony with the name, which had, at length, so identified the two as to merge the original title of the estate in the quaint and\\xa0equivocal\\xa0appellation of the “House of Usher” – an appellation which seemed to include, in the minds of the peasantry who used it, both the family and the family mansion.\\nI have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish experiment – that of looking down within the\\xa0tarn – had been to deepen the first singular impression. There can be no doubt that the consciousness of the rapid increase of my superstition – for why should I not so term it? – served mainly to accelerate the increase itself. Such, I have long known, is the\\xa0paradoxical\\xa0law of all sentiments having terror as a basis. And it might have been for this reason only, that, when I again uplifted my eyes to the house itself, from its image in the pool, there grew in my mind a strange fancy – a fancy so ridiculous, indeed, that I but mention it to show the vivid force of the sensations which oppressed me. I had so worked upon my imagination as really to believe that about the whole mansion and domain there hung an atmosphere peculiar to themselves and their immediate vicinity-an atmosphere which had no affinity with the air of heaven, but which had reeked up from the decayed trees, and the gray wall, and the silent\\xa0tarn – a pestilent and mystic vapour, dull, sluggish, faintly discernible, and leaden-hued.\\nShaking off from my spirit what must have been a dream, I scanned more narrowly the real aspect of the building. Its principal feature seemed to be that of an excessive antiquity. The discoloration of ages had been great. Minute fungi overspread the whole exterior, hanging in a fine tangled web-work from the eaves. Yet all this was apart from any extraordinary dilapidation. No portion of the masonry had fallen; and there appeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfect adaptation of parts, and the crumbling condition of the individual stones. In this there was much that reminded me of the specious totality of old wood-work which has rotted for long years in some neglected vault, with no disturbance from the breath of the external air. Beyond this indication of extensive decay, however, the fabric gave little token of instability. Perhaps the eye of a scrutinising observer might have discovered a barely perceptible fissure, which, extending from the roof of the building in front, made its way down the wall in a zigzag direction, until it became lost in the\\xa0sullen\\xa0waters of the\\xa0tarn.\\nNoticing these things, I rode over a short causeway to the house. A servant in waiting took my horse, and I entered the Gothic archway of the hall. A valet, of stealthy step, thence conducted me, in silence, through many dark and intricate passages in my progress to the studio of his master. Much that I encountered on the way contributed, I know not how, to heighten the vague sentiments of which I have already spoken. While the objects around me – while the carvings of the ceilings, the sombre tapestries of the walls, the ebon blacknes',\n",
              "  's of the floors, and the\\xa0phantasmagoric\\xa0armorial trophies which rattled as I strode, were but matters to which, or to such as which, I had been accustomed from my infancy – while I hesitated not to acknowledge how familiar was all this – I still wondered to find how unfamiliar were the fancies which ordinary images were stirring up. On one of the staircases, I met the physician of the family. His countenance, I thought, wore a mingled expression of low cunning and perplexity. He accosted me with\\xa0trepidation\\xa0and passed on. The valet now threw open a door and ushered me into the presence of his master.\\nThe room in which I found myself was very large and lofty. The windows were long, narrow, and pointed, and at so vast a distance from the black oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible from within. Feeble gleams of encrimsoned light made their way through the trellised panes, and served to render sufficiently distinct the more prominent objects around; the eye, however, struggled in vain to reach the remoter angles of the chamber, or the recesses of the vaulted and fretted ceiling. Dark draperies hung upon the walls. The general furniture was profuse, comfortless, antique, and tattered. Many books and musical instruments lay scattered about, but failed to give any vitality to the scene. I felt that I breathed an atmosphere of sorrow. An air of stern, deep, and irredeemable gloom hung over and pervaded all.\\nUpon my entrance, Usher arose from a sofa on which he had been lying at full length, and greeted me with a vivacious warmth which had much in it, I at first thought, of an overdone cordiality – of the constrained effort of the ennuyé man of the world. A glance, however, at his countenance, convinced me of his perfect sincerity. We sat down; and for some moments, while he spoke not, I gazed upon him with a feeling half of pity, half of awe. Surely, man had never before so terribly altered, in so brief a period, as had Roderick Usher! It was with difficulty that I could bring myself to admit the identity of the wan being before me with the companion of my early boyhood. Yet the character of his face had been at all times remarkable. A cadaverousness of complexion; an eye large, liquid, and luminous beyond comparison; lips somewhat thin and very pallid, but of a surpassingly beautiful curve; a nose of a delicate Hebrew model, but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations; a finely moulded chin, speaking, in its want of prominence, of a want of moral energy; hair of a more than web-like softness and tenuity; these features, with an inordinate expansion above the regions of the temple, made up altogether a countenance not easily to be forgotten. And now in the mere exaggeration of the prevailing character of these features, and of the expression they were wont to convey, lay so much of change that I doubted to whom I spoke. The now ghastly pallor of the skin, and the now miraculous lustre of the eve, above all things startled and even awed me. The silken hair, too, had been suffered to grow all unheeded, and as, in its wild gossamer texture, it floated rather than fell about the face, I could not, even with effort, connect its Arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity.\\nIn the manner of my friend I was at once struck with an incoherence – an inconsistency; and I soon found this to arise from a series of feeble and futile struggles to overcome an habitual trepidancy – an excessive nervous agitation. For something of this nature I had indeed been prepared, no less by his letter, than by reminiscences of certain boyish traits, and by conclusions deduced from his peculiar physical conformation and temperament. His action was alternately vivacious and\\xa0sullen. His voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision (when the animal spirits seemed utterly in\\xa0abeyance) to that species of energetic concision – that abrupt, weighty, unhurried, and hollow-sounding enunciation – that leaden, self-balanced and perfectly modulated guttural utterance, which may be observed in the lost drunkard, or the irreclaimable eater of opium, during the periods of his most intense excitement.\\nIt was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit, of his earnest desire to see me, and of the solace he expected me to afford him. He entered, at some length, into what he conceived to be the nature of his malady. It was, he said, ',\n",
              "  'a constitutional and a family evil, and one for which he despaired to find a remedy – a mere nervous affection, he immediately added, which would undoubtedly soon pass off. It displayed itself in a host of unnatural sensations. Some of these, as he detailed them, interested and bewildered me; although, perhaps, the terms, and the general manner of the narration had their weight. He suffered much from a morbid acuteness of the senses; the most insipid food was alone endurable; he could wear only garments of certain texture; the odours of all flowers were oppressive; his eyes were tortured by even a faint light; and there were but peculiar sounds, and these from stringed instruments, which did not inspire him with horror.\\nTo an\\xa0anomalous\\xa0species of terror I found him a bounden slave. “I shall perish,” said he, “I must perish in this deplorable folly. Thus, thus, and not otherwise, shall I be lost. I dread the events of the future, not in themselves, but in their results. I shudder at the thought of any, even the most trivial, incident, which may operate upon this intolerable agitation of soul. I have, indeed, no abhorrence of danger, except in its absolute effect – in terror. In this unnerved-in this pitiable condition – I feel that the period will sooner or later arrive when I must abandon life and reason together, in some struggle with the grim\\xa0phantasm, FEAR.”\\nI learned, moreover, at intervals, and through broken and\\xa0equivocal\\xa0hints, another singular feature of his mental condition. He was enchained by certain superstitious impressions in regard to the dwelling which he tenanted, and whence, for many years, he had never ventured forth – in regard to an influence whose supposititious force was conveyed in terms too shadowy here to be re-stated – an influence which some peculiarities in the mere form and substance of his family mansion, had, by\\xa0dint\\xa0of long sufferance, he said, obtained over his spirit-an effect which the physique of the gray walls and turrets, and of the dim\\xa0tarn\\xa0into which they all looked down, had, at length, brought about upon the morale of his existence.\\nHe admitted, however, although with hesitation, that much of the peculiar gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a more natural and far more\\xa0palpable\\xa0origin – to the severe and long-continued illness – indeed to the evidently approaching dissolution-of a tenderly beloved sister – his sole companion for long years – his last and only relative on earth. “Her decease,” he said, with a bitterness which I can never forget, “would leave him (him the hopeless and the frail) the last of the ancient race of the Ushers.” While he spoke, the lady Madeline (for so was she called) passed slowly through a remote portion of the apartment, and, without having noticed my presence, disappeared. I regarded her with an utter astonishment not unmingled with dread – and yet I found it impossible to account for such feelings. A sensation of stupor oppressed me, as my eyes followed her retreating steps. When a door, at length, closed upon her, my glance sought instinctively and eagerly the countenance of the brother – but he had buried his face in his hands, and I could only perceive that a far more than ordinary wanness had overspread the emaciated fingers through which trickled many passionate tears.\\nThe disease of the lady Madeline had long baffled the skill of her physicians. A settled apathy, a gradual wasting away of the person, and frequent although transient affections of a partially\\xa0cataleptical\\xa0character, were the unusual diagnosis. Hitherto she had steadily borne up against the pressure of her malady, and had not betaken herself finally to bed; but, on the closing in of the evening of my arrival at the house, she succumbed (as her brother told me at night with inexpressible agitation) to the prostrating power of the destroyer; and I learned that the glimpse I had obtained of her person would thus probably be the last I should obtain – that the lady, at least while living, would be seen by me no more.\\nFor several days ensuing, her name was unmentioned by either Usher or myself: and during this period I was busied in earnest endeavours to alleviate the melancholy of my friend. We painted and read together; or I listened, as if in a dream, to the wild improvisations of his speaking guitar. And thus, as a closer and still intimacy admitted me more un',\n",
              "  'reservedly into the recesses of his spirit, the more bitterly did I perceive the futility of all attempt at cheering a mind from which darkness, as if an inherent positive quality, poured forth upon all objects of the moral and physical universe, in one unceasing radiation of gloom.\\nI shall ever bear about me a memory of the many solemn hours I thus spent alone with the master of the House of Usher. Yet I should fail in any attempt to convey an idea of the exact character of the studies, or of the occupations, in which he involved me, or led me the way. An excited and highly distempered ideality threw a\\xa0sulphureous\\xa0lustre over all. His long improvised dirges will ring forever in my ears. Among other things, I hold painfully in mind a certain singular perversion and amplification of the wild air of the last waltz of Von Weber. From the paintings over which his elaborate fancy brooded, and which grew, touch by touch, into vaguenesses at which I shuddered the more thrillingly, because I shuddered knowing not why; – from these paintings (vivid as their images now are before me) I would in vain endeavour to educe more than a small portion which should lie within the compass of merely written words. By the utter simplicity, by the nakedness of his designs, he arrested and overawed attention. If ever mortal painted an idea, that mortal was Roderick Usher. For me at least – in the circumstances then surrounding me – there arose out of the pure abstractions which the hypochondriac contrived to throw upon his canvas, an intensity of intolerable awe, no shadow of which felt I ever yet in the contemplation of the certainly glowing yet too concrete reveries of\\xa0Fuseli.\\nOne of the\\xa0phantasmagoric\\xa0conceptions of my friend, partaking not so rigidly of the spirit of abstraction, may be shadowed forth, although feebly, in words. A small picture presented the interior of an immensely long and rectangular vault or tunnel, with low walls, smooth, white, and without interruption or device. Certain accessory points of the design served well to convey the idea that this excavation lay at an exceeding depth below the surface of the earth. No outlet was observed in any portion of its vast extent, and no torch, or other artificial source of light was discernible; yet a flood of intense rays rolled throughout, and bathed the whole in a ghastly and inappropriate splendour.\\nI have just spoken of that morbid condition of the auditory nerve which rendered all music intolerable to the sufferer, with the exception of certain effects of stringed instruments. It was, perhaps, the narrow limits to which he thus confined himself upon the guitar, which gave birth, in great measure, to the fantastic character of his performances. But the fervid facility of his impromptus could not be so accounted for. They must have been, and were, in the notes, as well as in the words of his wild fantasias (for he not unfrequently accompanied himself with rhymed verbal improvisations), the result of that intense mental collectedness and concentration to which I have previously alluded as observable only in particular moments of the highest artificial excitement. The words of one of these rhapsodies I have easily remembered. I was, perhaps, the more forcibly impressed with it, as he gave it, because, in the under or mystic current of its meaning, I fancied that I perceived, and for the first time, a full consciousness on the part of Usher, of the tottering of his lofty reason upon her throne. The verses, which were entitled “The Haunted Palace,” ran very nearly, if not accurately, thus:\\nI.\\nIn the greenest of our valleys,\\nBy good angels tenanted,\\nOnce fair and stately palace –\\nRadiant palace – reared its head.\\nIn the monarch Thought’s dominion –\\nIt stood there!\\nNever seraph spread a pinion\\nOver fabric half so fair.\\nII.\\n\\n\\n\\nBanners yellow, glorious, golden,\\nOn its roof did float and flow;\\n(This – all this – was in the olden\\nTime long ago)\\nAnd every gentle air that dallied,\\nIn that sweet day,\\nAlong the ramparts plumed and\\xa0pallid,\\nA winged odour went away.\\nIII.\\nWanderers in that happy valley\\nThrough two luminous windows saw\\nSpirits moving musically\\nTo a lute’s well-tuned law,\\nRound about a throne, where sitting\\n(Porphyrogene!)\\nIn state his glory well befitting,\\nThe ruler of the realm was seen.\\nIV.\\nAnd all with pearl and ruby glowing\\nWas the fair palace door,\\nThrough which came ',\n",
              "  'flowing, flowing, flowing\\nAnd sparkling evermore,\\nA troop of Echoes whose sweet duty\\nWas but to sing,\\nIn voices of surpassing beauty,\\nThe wit and wisdom of their king.\\nV.\\nBut evil things, in robes of sorrow,\\nAssailed the monarch’s high estate;\\n(Ah, let us mourn, for never morrow\\nShall dawn upon him, desolate!)\\nAnd, round about his home, the glory\\nThat blushed and bloomed\\nIs but a dim-remembered story\\nOf the old time entombed.\\nVI.\\nAnd travellers now within that valley,\\nThrough the red-litten windows, see\\nVast forms that move fantastically\\nTo a discordant melody;\\nWhile, like a rapid ghastly river,\\nThrough the pale door,\\nA hideous throng rush out forever,\\nAnd laugh – but smile no more.\\nI well remember that suggestions arising from this ballad led us into a train of thought wherein there became manifest an opinion of Usher’s which I mention not so much on account of its novelty, (for other men2 have thought thus,) as on account of the pertinacity with which he maintained it. This opinion, in its general form, was that of the sentience of all vegetable things. But, in his disordered fancy, the idea had assumed a more daring character, and trespassed, under certain conditions, upon the kingdom of inorganization. I lack words to express the full extent, or the earnest abandon of his persuasion. The belief, however, was connected (as I have previously hinted) with the gray stones of the home of his forefathers. The conditions of the sentience had been here, he imagined, fulfilled in the method of collocation of these stones – in the order of their arrangement, as well as in that of the many fungi which overspread them, and of the decayed trees which stood around – above all, in the long undisturbed endurance of this arrangement, and in its reduplication in the still waters of the tarn. Its evidence – the evidence of the sentience – was to be seen, he said, (and I here started as he spoke,) in the gradual yet certain condensation of an atmosphere of their own about the waters and the walls. The result was discoverable, he added, in that silent, yet importunate and terrible influence which for centuries had moulded the destinies of his family, and which made him what I now saw him – what he was. Such opinions need no comment, and I will make none.\\nOur books – the books which, for years, had formed no small portion of the mental existence of the invalid – were, as might be supposed, in strict keeping with this character of\\xa0phantasm. We pored together over such works as the\\xa0Ververt et Chartreuse\\xa0of Gresset; the\\xa0Belphegor\\xa0of\\xa0Machiavelli; the Heaven and Hell of\\xa0Swedenborg; the Subterranean Voyage of\\xa0Nicholas Klimm\\xa0by Holberg; the\\xa0Chiromancy of Robert Flud, of Jean D’Indaginé, and of De la Chambre; the Journey into the\\xa0Blue Distance of Tieck; and the City of the Sun of\\xa0Campanella. One favourite volume was a small octavo edition of the\\xa0Directorium Inquisitorum, by the Dominican Eymeric de Gironne; and there were passages in Pomponius Mela, about the old African Satyrs and Ægipans, over which Usher would sit dreaming for hours. His chief delight, however, was found in the perusal of an exceedingly rare and curious book in quarto Gothic – the manual of a forgotten church – the Vigilae Mortuorum secundum Chorum Ecclesiae Maguntinae.\\nI could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work, and of its probable influence upon the hypochondriac, when, one evening, having informed me abruptly that the lady Madeline was no more, he stated his intention of preserving her corpse for a\\xa0fortnight, (previously to its final interment,) in one of the numerous vaults within the main walls of the building. The worldly reason, however, assigned for this singular proceeding, was one which I did not feel at liberty to dispute. The brother had been led to his resolution (so he told me) by consideration of the unusual character of the malady of the deceased, of certain obtrusive and eager inquiries on the part of her medical men, and of the remote and exposed situation of the burial-ground of the family. I will not deny that when I called to mind the sinister countenance of the person whom I met upon the stair case, on the day of my arrival at the house, I had no desire to oppose what I regarded as at best but a harmless, and by no means an unnatural, precaution.\\nAt the request of Usher, I personally aided him in the arrangements for the temporary ent',\n",
              "  'ombment. The body having been encoffined, we two alone bore it to its rest. The vault in which we placed it (and which had been so long unopened that our torches, half smothered in its oppressive atmosphere, gave us little opportunity for investigation) was small, damp, and entirely without means of admission for light; lying, at great depth, immediately beneath that portion of the building in which was my own sleeping apartment. It had been used, apparently, in remote feudal times, for the worst purposes of a\\xa0donjon-keep, and, in later days, as a place of deposit for powder, or some other highly combustible substance, as a portion of its floor, and the whole interior of a long archway through which we reached it, were carefully sheathed with copper. The door, of massive iron, had been, also, similarly protected. Its immense weight caused an unusually sharp grating sound, as it moved upon its hinges.\\nHaving deposited our mournful burden upon tressels within this region of horror, we partially turned aside the yet unscrewed lid of the coffin, and looked upon the face of the tenant. A striking similitude between the brother and sister now first arrested my attention; and Usher, divining, perhaps, my thoughts, murmured out some few words from which I learned that the deceased and himself had been twins, and that sympathies of a scarcely intelligible nature had always existed between them. Our glances, however, rested not long upon the dead – for we could not regard her unawed. The disease which had thus entombed the lady in the maturity of youth, had left, as usual in all maladies of a strictly\\xa0cataleptical\\xa0character, the mockery of a faint blush upon the bosom and the face, and that suspiciously lingering smile upon the lip which is so terrible in death. We replaced and screwed down the lid, and, having secured the door of iron, made our way, with toll, into the scarcely less gloomy apartments of the upper portion of the house.\\nAnd now, some days of bitter grief having elapsed, an observable change came over the features of the mental disorder of my friend. His ordinary manner had vanished. His ordinary occupations were neglected or forgotten. He roamed from chamber to chamber with hurried, unequal, and objectless step. The pallor of his countenance had assumed, if possible, a more ghastly hue – but the luminousness of his eye had utterly gone out. The once occasional huskiness of his tone was heard no more; and a tremulous quaver, as if of extreme terror, habitually characterized his utterance. There were times, indeed, when I thought his unceasingly agitated mind was labouring with some oppressive secret, to divulge which he struggled for the necessary courage. At times, again, I was obliged to resolve all into the mere inexplicable vagaries of madness, for I beheld him gazing upon vacancy for long hours, in an attitude of the profoundest attention, as if listening to some imaginary sound. It was no wonder that his condition terrified-that it infected me. I felt creeping upon me, by slow yet certain degrees, the wild influences of his own fantastic yet impressive superstitions.\\nIt was, especially, upon retiring to bed late in the night of the seventh or eighth day after the placing of the lady Madeline within the donjon, that I experienced the full power of such feelings. Sleep came not near my couch – while the hours waned and waned away. I struggled to reason off the nervousness which had dominion over me. I endeavoured to believe that much, if not all of what I felt, was due to the bewildering influence of the gloomy furniture of the room – of the dark and tattered draperies, which, tortured into motion by the breath of a rising\\xa0tempest, swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls, and rustled uneasily about the decorations of the bed. But my efforts were fruitless. An irrepressible tremour gradually pervaded my frame; and, at length, there sat upon my very heart an\\xa0incubus\\xa0of utterly causeless alarm. Shaking this off with a gasp and a struggle, I uplifted myself upon the pillows, and, peering earnestly within the intense darkness of the chamber, hearkened – I know not why, except that an instinctive spirit prompted me – to certain low and indefinite sounds which came, through the pauses of the storm, at long intervals, I knew not whence. Overpowered by an intense sentiment of horror, unaccountable yet unendurable',\n",
              "  ', I threw on my clothes with haste (for I felt that I should sleep no more during the night), and endeavoured to arouse myself from the pitiable condition into which I had fallen, by pacing rapidly to and fro through the apartment.\\nI had taken but few turns in this manner, when a light step on an adjoining staircase arrested my attention. I presently recognised it as that of Usher. In an instant afterward he rapped, with a gentle touch, at my door, and entered, bearing a lamp. His countenance was, as usual,\\xa0cadaverously\\xa0wan – but, moreover, there was a species of mad hilarity in his eyes – an evidently restrained hysteria in his whole demeanour. His air appalled me – but anything was preferable to the solitude which I had so long endured, and I even welcomed his presence as a relief.\\n“And you have not seen it?” he said abruptly, after having stared about him for some moments in silence – “you have not then seen it? – but, stay! you shall.” Thus speaking, and having carefully shaded his lamp, he hurried to one of the casements, and threw it freely open to the storm.\\nThe impetuous fury of the entering gust nearly lifted us from our feet. It was, indeed, a\\xa0tempestuous\\xa0yet sternly beautiful night, and one wildly singular in its terror and its beauty. A whirlwind had apparently collected its force in our vicinity; for there were frequent and violent alterations in the direction of the wind; and the exceeding density of the clouds (which hung so low as to press upon the turrets of the house) did not prevent our perceiving the life-like velocity with which they flew careering from all points against each other, without passing away into the distance. I say that even their exceeding density did not prevent our perceiving this – yet we had no glimpse of the moon or stars – nor was there any flashing forth of the lightning. But the under surfaces of the huge masses of agitated vapour, as well as all terrestrial objects immediately around us, were glowing in the unnatural light of a faintly luminous and distinctly visible gaseous exhalation which hung about and enshrouded the mansion.\\n“You must not – you shall not behold this!” said I, shudderingly, to Usher, as I led him, with a gentle violence, from the window to a seat. “These appearances, which bewilder you, are merely electrical phenomena not uncommon – or it may be that they have their ghastly origin in the rank miasma of the\\xa0tarn. Let us close this casement; – the air is chilling and dangerous to your frame. Here is one of your favourite romances. I will read, and you shall listen; – and so we will pass away this terrible night together.”\\nThe antique volume which I had taken up was the Mad Trist of Sir Launcelot Canning; but I had called it a favourite of Usher’s more in sad jest than in earnest; for, in truth, there is little in its uncouth and unimaginative prolixity which could have had interest for the lofty and spiritual ideality of my friend. It was, however, the only book immediately at hand; and I indulged a vague hope that the excitement which now agitated the hypochondriac, might find relief (for the history of mental disorder is full of similar anomalies) even in the extremeness of the folly which I should read. Could I have judged, indeed, by the wild over-strained air of vivacity with which he hearkened, or apparently hearkened, to the words of the tale, I might well have congratulated myself upon the success of my design.\\nI had arrived at that well-known portion of the story where Ethelred, the hero of the Trist, having sought in vain for peaceable admission into the dwelling of the hermit, proceeds to make good an entrance by force. Here, it will be remembered, the words of the narrative run thus:\\n“And Ethelred, who was by nature of a doughty heart, and who was now mighty withal, on account of the powerfulness of the wine which he had drunken, waited no longer to hold parley with the hermit, who,\\xa0in sooth, was of an obstinate and maliceful turn, but, feeling the rain upon his shoulders, and fearing the rising of the\\xa0tempest, uplifted his mace outright, and, with blows, made quickly room in the plankings of the door for his gauntleted hand; and now pulling there-with sturdily, he so cracked, and ripped, and tore all asunder, that the noise of the dry and hollow-sounding wood alarumed and reverberated throughout the forest.\\nAt the termination of this sente',\n",
              "  'nce I started, and for a moment, paused; for it appeared to me (although I at once concluded that my excited fancy had deceived me) – it appeared to me that, from some very remote portion of the mansion, there came, indistinctly, to my ears, what might have been, in its exact similarity of character, the echo (but a stifled and dull one certainly) of the very cracking and ripping sound which Sir Launcelot had so particularly described. It was, beyond doubt, the coincidence alone which had arrested my attention; for, amid the rattling of the sashes of the casements, and the ordinary commingled noises of the still increasing storm, the sound, in itself, had nothing, surely, which should have interested or disturbed me. I continued the story:\\n“But the good champion Ethelred, now entering within the door, was sore enraged and amazed to perceive no signal of the maliceful hermit; but, in the stead thereof, a dragon of a scaly and\\xa0prodigious\\xa0demeanour, and of a fiery tongue, which\\xa0sate\\xa0in guard before a palace of gold, with a floor of silver; and upon the wall there hung a shield of shining brass with this legend enwritten –\\n\\n\\n\\nWho entereth herein, a conqueror hath bin;\\nWho slayeth the dragon, the shield he shall win;\\nand Ethelred uplifted his mace, and struck upon the head of the dragon, which fell before him, and gave up his pesty breath, with a shriek so horrid and harsh, and withal so piercing, that Ethelred had fain to close his ears with his hands against the dreadful noise of it, the like whereof was never before heard.”\\nHere again I paused abruptly, and now with a feeling of wild amazement – for there could be no doubt whatever that, in this instance, I did actually hear (although from what direction it proceeded I found it impossible to say) a low and apparently distant, but harsh, protracted, and most unusual screaming or grating sound – the exact counterpart of what my fancy had already conjured up for the dragon’s unnatural shriek as described by the romancer.\\nOppressed, as I certainly was, upon the occurrence of the second and most extraordinary coincidence, by a thousand conflicting sensations, in which wonder and extreme terror were predominant, I still retained sufficient presence of mind to avoid exciting, by any observation, the sensitive nervousness of my companion. I was by no means certain that he had noticed the sounds in question; although, assuredly, a strange alteration had, during the last few minutes, taken place in his demeanour. From a position fronting my own, he had gradually brought round his chair, so as to sit with his face to the door of the chamber; and thus I could but partially perceive his features, although I saw that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring inaudibly. His head had dropped upon his breast – yet I knew that he was not asleep, from the wide and rigid opening of the eye as I caught a glance of it in profile. The motion of his body, too, was at variance with this idea – for he rocked from side to side with a gentle yet constant and uniform sway. Having rapidly taken notice of all this, I resumed the narrative of Sir Launcelot, which thus proceeded:\\n“And now, the champion, having escaped from the terrible fury of the dragon, bethinking himself of the brazen shield, and of the breaking up of the enchantment which was upon it, removed the carcass from out of the way before him, and approached valorously over the silver pavement of the castle to where the shield was upon the wall; which\\xa0in sooth\\xa0tarried not for his full coming, but fell down at his feet upon the silver floor, with a mighty great and terrible ringing sound.”\\nNo sooner had these syllables passed my lips, than – as if a shield of brass had indeed, at the moment, fallen heavily upon a floor of silver, became aware of a distinct, hollow, metallic, and clangorous, yet apparently muffled reverberation. Completely unnerved, I leaped to my feet; but the measured rocking movement of Usher was undisturbed. I rushed to the chair in which he sat. His eyes were bent fixedly before him, and throughout his whole countenance there reigned a stony rigidity. But, as I placed my hand upon his shoulder, there came a strong shudder over his whole person; a sickly smile quivered about his lips; and I saw that he spoke in a low, hurried, and gibbering murmur, as if unconscious of my presence. Bending closely over him, I at lengt',\n",
              "  'h drank in the hideous import of his words.\\n“Not hear it? – yes, I hear it, and have heard it. Long – long – long – many minutes, many hours, many days, have I heard it – yet I dared not – oh, pity me, miserable wretch that I am! – I dared not – I dared not speak! We have put her living in the tomb! Said I not that my senses were\\xa0acute? I now tell you that I heard her first feeble movements in the hollow coffin. I heard them – many, many days ago – yet I dared not – I dared not speak! And now – to-night – Ethelred – ha! ha! – the breaking of the hermit’s door, and the death-cry of the dragon, and the clangour of the shield! – say, rather, the rending of her coffin, and the grating of the iron hinges of her prison, and her struggles within the coppered archway of the vault! Oh whither shall I fly? Will she not be here anon? Is she not hurrying to upbraid me for my haste? Have I not heard her footstep on the stair? Do I not distinguish that heavy and horrible beating of her heart? MADMAN!” here he sprang furiously to his feet, and shrieked out his syllables, as if in the effort he were giving up his soul – “MADMAN! I TELL YOU THAT SHE NOW STANDS WITHOUT THE DOOR!”\\nAs if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there had been found the potency of a spell – the huge antique panels to which the speaker pointed, threw slowly back, upon the instant, ponderous and ebony jaws. It was the work of the rushing gust – but then without those doors there DID stand the lofty and enshrouded figure of the lady Madeline of Usher. There was blood upon her white robes, and the evidence of some bitter struggle upon every portion of her emaciated frame. For a moment she remained trembling and reeling to and fro upon the threshold, then, with a low moaning cry, fell heavily inward upon the person of her brother, and in her violent and now final death-agonies, bore him to the floor a corpse, and a victim to the terrors he had anticipated.\\nFrom that chamber, and from that mansion, I fled\\xa0aghast. The storm was still abroad in all its wrath as I found myself crossing the old causeway. Suddenly there shot along the path a wild light, and I turned to see whence a gleam so unusual could have issued; for the vast house and its shadows were alone behind me. The radiance was that of the full, setting, and blood-red moon which now shone vividly through that once barely-discernible fissure of which I have before spoken as extending from the roof of the building, in a zig-zag direction, to the base. While I gazed, this fissure rapidly widened – there came a fierce breath of the whirlwind – the entire orb of the satellite burst at once upon my sight – my brain reeled as I saw the mighty walls rushing asunder – there was a long tumultuous shouting sound like the voice of a thousand waters – and the deep and dank\\xa0tarn\\xa0at my feet closed sullenly and silently over the fragments of the “HOUSE OF USHER.”\\n* * *\\nNOTES\\n1. The epigraph at the beginning of Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Fall of the House of Usher,” taken from a poem by Pierre Jean de Béranger, serves as a metaphorical preface to the story’s themes and atmosphere. The lines, “Son cœur est un luth suspendu; Sitôt qu’on le touche il résonne,” translate to “His heart is a lute suspended; As soon as one touches it, it resonates.”\\nThis epigraph suggests a sensitivity to external influences, symbolizing the delicate and responsive nature of the human psyche. In the context of the story, it foreshadows the intense emotional and psychological states of the characters, particularly Roderick Usher, whose mental and physical condition is highly susceptible to his environment. The Usher family home, a Gothic mansion that is almost a character in its own right, acts as an external embodiment of Roderick’s internal state, with its decaying structure mirroring his deteriorating mind. The epigraph hints at the central themes of the story: the interplay between the physical and psychological, the impact of the past on the present, and the idea that both the human mind and the environments we inhabit are easily affected by stimuli, capable of producing profound reactions to seemingly minor provocations. It sets the stage for a tale where atmosphere, setting, and emotion resonate together, much like the strings of a lute respond to a touch.\\n2.

Along with Ralph Waldo Emerson, Thoreau was one of the most important thinkers of his time in America and is still widely read today. Walden (1854), the work for which he is best known, is drawn from the journal he kept during his two-year-long stay in a cabin on Walden Pond. In Walden, Thoreau explores his interests in naturalism, individualism, and self-sufficiency. He is also remembered for his essay “Civil Disobedience” (1849), an early, influential statement of this tactic of protest later practiced by Mahatma Gandhi and, under the leadership of Martin Luther King Jr., many in the civil rights movement.\\n“Where I Lived, and What I Lived For” is taken from Walden. In it, Thoreau makes the argument for his going to live in the woods. Writing about Walden, scholars have pointed out that Thoreau was not particularly deep in the woods and that he was regularly visited and supplied with, among other things, pies. As you read, consider how this influences your acceptance of what he has to say.\\nby Henry David Thoreau\\nI went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practice resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swat',\n",

For most men, it appears to me, are in a strange uncertainty about it, whether it is of the devil or of God, and have somewhat hastily concluded that it is the chief end of man here to “glorify God and enjoy him forever.”\\nStill we live meanly, like ants; though the fable tells us that we were long ago changed into men; like pygmies we fight with cranes; it is error upon error, and clout upon clout, and our best virtue has for its occasion a superfluous and evitable wretchedness. Our life is frittered away by detail. An honest man has hardly need to count more than his ten fingers, or in extreme cases he may add his ten toes, and lump the rest. Simplicity, simplicity, simplicity! I say, let your affairs be as two or three, and not a hundred or a thousand; instead of a million count half a dozen, and keep your accounts on your thumb-nail. In the midst of this chopping sea of civilized life, such are the clouds and storms and quicksands and thousand-and-one items to be allowed for, that a man has to live, if he would not founder and go to the bottom and not make his port at all, by dead reckoning, and he must be a great calculator indeed who succeeds.

The nation itself, with all its so-called internal improvements, which, by the way are all external and superficial, is just such an unwieldy and overgrown establishment, cluttered with furniture and tripped up by its own traps, ruined by luxury and heedless expense, by want of calculation and a worthy aim, as the million households in the lands; and the only cure for it, as for them, is in a rigid economy, a stem and more than Spartan simplicity of life and elevation of purpose. It lives too fast. Men think that it is essential that the Nation have commerce, and export ice, and talk through a telegraph, and ride thirty miles an hour, without a doubt, whether they do or not; but whether we should live like baboons or like men, is a little uncertain. If we do not get our sleepers, and forge rails, and devote days and nights to the work, but go to tinkering upon our lives to improve them, who will build railroads? And if railroads are not built, how shall we get to heaven in season? But if we stay at home and mind our business, who will want railroads? We do not ride on the railroad; it rides upon us. Did you ever think what those sleepers are that underlie the railroad? Each one is a man, an Irishman, or a Yankee man. The rails are laid on them, and they are covered with sand, and the cars run smoothly over them. They are sound sleepers, I assure you. And every few years a new lot is laid down and run over, so that, if some have the pleasure of ridi',\n",

And when they run over a man that is walking in his sleep, a supernumerary sleeper in the wrong position, and wake him up, they suddenly stop the cars, and make a hue and cry about it, as if this were an exception. I am glad to know that it takes a gang of men for every five miles to keep the sleepers down and level in their beds as it is, for this is a sign that they may sometimes get up again.\\nWhy should we live with such hurry and waste of life? We are determined to be starved before we are hungry. Men say that a stitch in time saves nine, and so they take a thousand stitches today to save nine tomorrow. As for work, we haven’t any of any consequence. We have the Saint Vitus’ dance, and cannot possibly keep our heads still. If I should only give a few pulls at the parish bell-rope, as for a fire, that is, without setting the bell, there is hardly a man on his farm in the outskirts of Concord, notwithstanding that press of engagements which was his excuse so many times this morning, nor a boy, nor a woman, I might almost say, but would foresake all and follow that sound, not mainly to save property from the flames, but, if we will confess the truth, much more to see it bum, since bum it must, and we, be it known, did not set it on fire—or to see it put out, and have a hand in it, if that is done as handsomely; yes, even if it were the parish church itself.

The penny-post is, commonly, an institution through which you seriously offer a man that penny for his thoughts which is so often safely offered in jest. And I am sure that I never read any memorable news in a newspaper. If we read of one man robbed, or murdered, or killed bv accident, or one house burned, or one vessel wrecked or one steamboat blown up, or one cow run over on the Western Railroad, or one mad dog killed, or one lot of grasshoppers in the winter—we never need read of another.

As for Spain, for instance, if you know how to throw in Don Carlos and the Infanta, and Don Pedro and Seville and Granada, from time to time in the right proportions — they may have changed the names a little since I saw the papers — and serve up a bullfight when other entertainments fail, it will be true to the letter, and give us as good an idea of the exact state or min of things in Spain as the most succinct and lucid reports under this head in the newspapers; and as for England, almost the last significant scrap of news from that quarter was the revolution of 1649; and if you have learned the history of her crops for an average year, you never need attend to that thing again, unless your speculations are of a merely pecuniary character.

Avast! Why so seeming fast, but deadly slow?”\\nShams and delusions are esteemed for soundless truths, while reality is fabulous. If men would steadily observe realities only, and not allow themselves to be deluded, life, to compare it with such things as we know, would be like a fairy tale and the Arabian Nights’ Entertainments. If we respected only what is inevitable and has a right to be, music and poetry would resound along the streets. When we are unhurried and wise, we perceive that only great and worthy things have any permanent and absolute existence, that petty fears and petty pleasures are but the shadow of the reality. This is always exhilarating and sublime. By closing the eyes and slumbering, and consenting to be deceived by shows, men establish and confirm their daily life of routine and habit everywhere, which still is built on purely illusory foundations. Children, who play life, discern its true law and relations more clearly than men, who fail to live it worthily, but who think that they are wiser by experience, that is, by failure.

So soul,” continues the Hindoo philosopher, “from the circumstances in which it is placed, mistakes its own character, until the truth is revealed to it by some holy teacher and then it knows itself to be Brahme.” I perceive that we inhabitants of New England live this mean life that we do because our vision does not penetrate the surface of things. We think that that is which appears to be. If a man should walk through this town and see only the reality, where, think you, would the “Milldam” go to? If he should give us an account of the realities he beheld there, we should not recognize the place in his description. Look at the meetinghouse, or a courthouse, or a jail, or a shop, or a dwelling-house, and say what that thing really is before a true gaze, and they would all go to pieces in your account of them. Men esteem truth remote, in the outskirts of the system, behind the farthest star, before Adam and after the last man. In eternity there is indeed something true and sublime. But all these times and places and occasions are now and here. God himself culminates in the present moment, and will never be more divine in the lapse of all the ages.

It is known, of course, that Alice Walker is not a universal favorite among blacks. She hates black men with a passion, an antipathy black men return with some stoniness. Black women don’t always like her much either. A black woman said recently she was “tired of being beat over the head with this women’s lib stuff, this whole black woman/black man, ‘Lord have mercy on us po’ sisters.’ ” And it fell to a sensitive white woman, a core admirer, to confess that, once she’d gotten through The Color Purple’s first depressing chapters, the book was “so uplifting and true it made me cry.”\\nWhich is to say that this sensitive white woman was obviously not black, nor was she raised poor in rural Georgia before the First World War, nor was she raped by her father when she was thirteen, nor did she bear him two incestuous children, nor was she later abused by her husband, nor did she become a lesbian, but that the book was so uplifting she could somehow feel it was true.\\nAlice Walker has hatred to spare, and some slurps over onto white men, and even, in a half-hearted way, onto white women.

[It swallowed it.]\\nThe Color Purple is what is called an “epistolary” novel, which is to say it’s made up of letters, in this case between the novel’s heroine, Celie, who gets raped by her father and beaten by her husband and ends up a lesbian, and her younger sister Nettie. Things get pretty sticky when Nettie moves in with her married sister, Celie, and Celie’s husband, Albert. So Nettie runs away and the next thing you know she’s a missionary in Africa.\\nThe first miracle in this story is the improvement in Nettie’s prose style as soon as she gets away from home. Celie, of course, writes in Black English, which, for all I know, they’re teaching at Princeton these days. We fall on each other neck. She be my age but they married.

Now I realize that the Back-to-Africa movement isn’t very popular among American blacks. Stokely Carmichael and a few of his friends tried it for a while, but it didn’t last. The late Huey Newton even tried Back-to-Cuba (where Alice Walker interviewed him rever\\xadently), but only stuck it out three years. Even the 15,000 or so “Free Negroes” who were sent off to Liberia beginning in 1822 went begrudgingly, they say, even though they now run Liberia.

Now is this plain horse sense, or does Alice Walker know something about Africa nobody else knows?\\nToward the end of The Color Purple, which is somewhere in the 1930s, Celie twice has dealings with the U.S. “Defense Department.” But since at that time the Defense Department didn’t exist, you start to wonder, does Alice Walker’s Africa exi',\n",

Unlike those uppity Americo-Liberians, who are more American than Americans, Nettie’s missionaries, in the arms of whose wonderfully vulnerable leader she finds ecstasy, drink deep of the Olinka culture (this in 1910). They savor the wonderful friendships among the Olinka women. The missionary’s children “love the open feeling of the village, and love living in huts. They are excited by the hunting expertise of the men and the self-sufficiency of the women in raising their crops.” The Christian missionary’s boy scars his cheeks like the male Olinka.\\nThe Olinka scarify their children’s cheeks as a mark of their tribe, and have puberty rites for both boys and girls (although only Steven Spielberg introduces coeducational puberty rites, doubtless the influence of Reform Judaism on Africa).

An infirmary (what kind of doctors?). “Male and female warriors” go on sabotage raids against white plantations, all united in a common goal, “the uplift of black people everywhere.” Reading the book, I wondered—with fifty African states having attained independence at least twenty-five years ago and African culture now doubtless in full bloom—what Alice Walker is doing living surrounded by all those degenerate white people in northern California (with homes both in the country and in San Francisco).\\nImagine my shock, furthermore, when on consulting every reference book on Africa I could find no entry under “Olinka.” Since it’s a Slavic diminutive for “Olga,” it’s been suggested that Alice Walker might have picked it up at the Soviet-spon\\xadsored World Youth Peace Festival in Helsinki which she attended with Angela Davis, recently candidate for vice-president of the U.S. Communist Party.

Some 50 percent of Nigerians are Moslem, 35 percent Christian, the rest pagan, but, amazingly, no roof leaf.\\nSince independence in 1960, Nigeria has had an interesting history. The early years were marked by bitter conflict, which culminated in 1966 in two military coups d’état, the first by Ibo army officers, the second by Hausa army officers. In September Hausa tribesmen began massacring Ibo in the north, whereupon Ibo in the south seceded to form the temporarily independent state of Biafra. The two sides then fought a bloody, three-year civil war which left one million dead, all blacks killed by other blacks. Now where, you might ask, is that wonderful gathering place filled with Alice Walker’s happy Africans, united for the uplift of black people everywhere? The answer might explain why Alice Walker is living in California.\\nA difference between Alice Walker and me, of course,',\n",
              "  ' is that I have been to Africa, many times, while I have the funny feeling she has not. It takes a lot of nerve to set a large part of a major novel in a place you’ve only daydreamed about. And since I don’t believe a word of what Alice Walker says about Africa, why should I believe what she tells me about the woes of a black lesbian in the Georgia of 1910—a place she’s never been to either, come to think of it.\\nSearching for the root of Alice Walker’s African daydreams, I’ve read her collected essays in what she calls “womanist” prose. I find she’s written a passionate celebration of Fidel Castro’s Cuban Revolution. She’s an ardent admirer of nuclear-surrender advocate Helen Caldicott. She writes that nothing bad happens in China any more since the Communist Revolution. She published this in 1976, before the death of Mao and the fall of the Gang of Four. With 30 million Chinese dead thanks to Mao, according to his successors, and even more recent dra\\xadmatic events, one wonders what Alice Walker has to say about China now.\\nPondering how a sane college graduate could possibly have dreamed up a place as fanciful as Alice Walker’s Africa, I came across the most curious of her “womanist” memoirs.

The wife admits Atlanta is nicer, but misses all her friends back in Boston. It hurts, she says, but you can’t have everything. This fills Alice Walker with derisive scorn, and she thinks jeeringly if mysteriously, “Yes, two hundred years ago you might have tried to escape to Canada, no matter what the slaves who’d already settled there wrote you of the murderous cold.”\\nI puzzled over this sentence quite a bit—because surely Alice Walker can’t be expressing contempt for a slave’s determination to be free. Surely a Canadian winter is less bad than continued servitude. Until I realized that the hot button was her relative’s remark, “You can’t have everything,” and I saw how limited was my sense of what is possible in this world. It suddenly came to me with a dizzying surge that the slave not only had a right to freedom, she had the right to a warm Canada. It’s that old earth-bound side of me. No imagination. I don’t believe in that wonderful secret gathering place filled with happy Africans united for the uplift of black people everywhere. And I’m not out there demanding a warm Canada.\\nWashington Times, January 3, 1986\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n'],\n",
              " ['\\n \\nVyvyan Holland, in his introduction to the 1966 edition of Oscar Wilde’s works, provides an insightful overview of his father’s lineage, life, and literary career. He recounts the family’s Dutch origin, Oscar’s upbringing and education, his rise in London society, and his contributions to literature, from poetry and essays to renowned plays like The Importance of Being Earnest. Holland also touches on the darker aspects of Wilde’s life, including his trial, imprisonment, and posthumous conversion to Catholicism, ultimately painting a complex and enduring portrait of one of the most celebrated figures in literary history.\\n* * *\\nINTRODUCTION TO THE 1966 EDITION\\nby Vyvyan Holland\\nOscar Wilde’s family is Dutch in origin. The first Wilde to settle in Ireland was a certain Colonel de Wilde, the son of an artist, examples of whose work hang in the Art Gallery at The Hague; he was a soldier of fortune who was granted lands in Connaught at the end of the seventeenth century for his services to King William III of England. He is said to have repented his adherence to the English king and to have become ‘more Irish than the Irish’. From that time the family were land agents and doctors.\\nMy father’s parents were both distinguished in their own way. Sir William Wilde was the foremost eye and ear specialist of his time, and a physician of international repute. He invented the operation for cataract and performed it on King Oscar of Sweden, for which he received the Order of the Polar Star. His mother, Lady Wilde, born Jane Francesca Elgee, was a staunch Irish Nationalist, who wrote fierce poems and articles in the Irish Nationalist newspaper The Nation, under the name of ‘Speranza’, a name she had adopted from her motto ‘Fidanza, Constanz',\n",
              "  'a, Speranza’ – Faith, Constancy, Hope. Lady Wilde had three children, William, Oscar and Isola, who died when she was ten, to Oscar’s lasting grief. Oscar Wilde was born on 16 October 1854, and was given the names Oscar Fingal O’Flahertie Wills Wilde.\\nHis education began at Portora Royal School In Enniskillen, from which he obtained a scholarship to Trinity College, Dublin, where he won the Berkeley Gold Medal for Greek. From there he received a demyship to Magdalen College, Oxford. While at Oxford he came under the Influence of John Ruskin and Walter Pater. Pater preached the love of Art for Art’s sake, and Oscar Wilde, going one step further, set out to idolise beauty for beauty’s sake and filled his rooms looking over the Cherwell with blue china and reproductions of paintings by Rossetti and Burne-Jones. Aestheticism was the key-note of his creed and he declared that beauty was the ideal after which everyone should strive.\\nMy father’s life at Oxford, one gathers from his letters, was a joyous one. He entered whole-heartedly into the undergraduate life of the University and distinguished himself by winning the Newdigate Prize for English verse and getting a double first in Classics. Upon this note he came to London in 1879 with the remains of a small patrimony and started to make his living by his pen. True to his doctrine of beauty he established himself as the ‘Apostle of Aestheticism’ and drew attention to himself by the eccentricity of his dress. It must be remembered that at this period the clothing of the British upper middle classes was rigidly conventional, and the sight of him in the evening in a velvet coat edged with braid, knee-breeches, black silk stockings, a soft loose shirt with a wide turn-down collar and a ',\n",
              "  'large flowing tie, was bound to arouse indignant curiosity.\\nAt the same time he was writing poems, and in 1880 he also wrote Vera, a rather immature play, which ran for one week in New York in 1883 and never reached the boards in London. In 1881 his collected poems were published, and in 1882, being short of money, he was persuaded to go on a lecture tour to America. This proved to be a brilliant success and he returned to England in 1883, covered, if not with glory, at least with considerable notoriety.\\nOn his return to Europe, he retired to Paris to finish another play, The Duchess of Padua, for the American actress Mary Anderson; but when she received the play, she turned it down flatly. This was really a disaster for Oscar Wilde, and he returned to England and went on a series of lecture tours in the provinces. However, this nomadic life soon palled and he returned to London where, in 1884, he married Constance Mary, daughter of a distinguished Irish barrister, Horace Lloyd, Q.C. Oscar was romantically in love with his beautiful young wife and for some years he was ideally happy. He had two sons by his wife – Cyril, born in 1885, and myself in 1886.\\nOddly enough, although his literary activities had been almost entirely confined to writing poetry until his marriage, he now turned largely to prose and, with the exception of The Sphinx, the idea of which had occurred to him much earlier, he wrote few poems until after his imprisonment, when he wrote The Ballad of Reading Gaol. Boris Brasol, who wrote one of the only two carefully considered lives of my father, sums up his poetic period as follows:\\n‘He began his literary career as a composer of sonorous and pleasing verses in which, however, as he himself admitted, ‘there was ',\n",
              "  'more rhyme than reason’; yet as he grew older, he seemed to have lost all taste for poetry, and though there Is nothing that would justify the contention that he ever regarded his early poems as callow productions, the fact remains that upon reaching maturity he took no further interest in that delightful occupation which Browning aptly called “the unlocking of hearts with sonnet keys”.’\\nUpon what, then, does his reputation as an author rest? His early poems were mostly lyrical, and certain of them will undoubtedly pass the test of time. His true literary life was spread over seven years only, from 1888 until 1894. In 1887 he had become editor of Woman’s World in which capacity he continued until 1889 when he resigned. He had gathered a reputation for eccentricity and, still more, as a conversationalist. There are few people alive now who remember his conversation, but when in 1954 a plaque was unveiled by Sir Compton Mackenzie on the house in Tite Street where my family lived for eleven years, he read the following message from Sir Max Beerbohm (the Incomparable Max!), who felt too frail to undertake the journey to London to be present:\\n‘I have had the privilege of listening to many masters of table talk – Meredith and Swinburne, Edmund Gosse and Henry James, Augustine Birrell and Arthur Balfour, Gilbert Chesterton and Desmond MacCarthy and Hilaire Belloc – all of them splendid in their own way. But Oscar was the greatest of them all – the most spontaneous and yet the most polished, the most soothing and yet the most surprising…Nobody was willing to interrupt the music of so magnificent a virtuoso. To have heard him consoled me for not having heard Dr Johnson or Edmund Burke, Lord Brougham or Sidney Smith.’\\nWinston Churchill w',\n",
              "  'as once asked whom he would like to meet and talk with in after life, and he replied, without hesitation: ‘Oscar Wilde.’\\nWilde’s first memorable work was The Happy Prince, which appeared in 1888. The stories in The Happy Prince are really poems in prose more than fairytales for children; and yet the remarkable thing is that they appeal equally to children and adults.\\nIn 1891 he produced a small volume ot tour stories which he had written some time previously. The book was called Lord Arthur Savile’s Crime and Other Stories, the other three tales being The Canterville Ghost’, The Sphinx without a Secret’ and ‘The Model Millionaire’. The first two of these stories have been dramatised and their substance has been copied on several occasions; they possess the light-hearted gaiety and insouciance that find their fullest expression in The Importance of Being Earnest, and show the buoyancy of my father’s spirit at that time.\\nA House of Pomegranates, my father’s other book of short stories – one can hardly call them fairy tales – appeared with illustrations by Charles Shannon, R.A. in the same year. This book completely puzzled the critics, who thought that the stories were meant for children and protested, quite rightly, that no child could understand them. This was followed by The Sphinx, which really dated from his Oxford days, and upon which he had worked at intervals ever since. The critics were again confused by the poem, which was really nothing more than an experiment with words. He revelled in finding rhymes for words such as hieroglyph and catafalque, which he rhymed with hippogriff and Amenalk.\\nIn 1891, too, Oscar Wilde’s only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, appeared in book form, enlarged from the original which had bee',\n",
              "  'n already published in Lippincott’s Magazine. The publication of this work was greeted with a storm of protest by the critics. The English Press was almost unanimous in its condemnation of the book. The Idea of the book had first come to my father some years before. Hesketh Pearson tells the story of it in his Life of Oscar Wilde;’ In the year 1884 Wilde used to drop in at the studio of a painter, Basil Ward, one of whose sitters was a young man of exceptional beauty…When the portrait was done and the youth had gone, Wilde happened to say, “What a pity that such a glorious creature should ever grow old!” The artist agreed, adding, “How delightful it would be if he could remain exactly as he is, while the portrait aged and withered in his stead!” Wilde expressed his obligation by calling the painter in his story Basil Hallward.’\\nBy far the most interesting and entertaining book of essays that Oscar Wilde wrote was Intentions, in which he really gave rein to his imagination. In my own opinion, it is the most absorbing of all his works. The Critic as Artist occupies considerably more than half of it; its sub-title ‘with some remarks upon the importance of doing nothing’ shows the curious charm the word ‘importance’ had for him; it occurs in the titles of two of his plays, and is constantly cropping up in his essays. It is almost as though the word held a strange sonorousness for him and that he liked to roll it, if not round his tongue, then round his mind.\\nBut the most interesting essay in the book is The Decay of Lying. The essay is in the form of a dialogue, the dominant theme being the vast superiority of Art over Nature, leading to the conclusion that Nature follows Art.\\nOscar Wilde now entered into his final stage, the one f',\n",
              "  'or which he was destined, that of a dramatist. In 1891 he wrote Lady Windermere’s Fan, which he described as ‘one of those modern drawing-room plays with pink lampshades’. It was produced at the St James’s Theatre in February, 1892 by George Alexander. There were loud cries of ‘Author!’ at the end of the play and Wilde came onto the stage with a cigarette in his gloved hand and said: ‘Ladies and Gentlemen. I have enjoyed this evening immensely. The actors have given us a charming rendering of a delightful play, and your appreciation has been most intelligent. I congratulate you on the great success of your performance which persuades me that you think almost as highly of the play as I do.’\\nWhen Wilde had finished Lady Windermere’s Fan he retired to Paris and wrote his Biblical play Salome in French, dedicated to Pierre Louys who made certain corrections in the French, but did not otherwise interfere with it. Sarah Bernhardt was immensely attracted to this play, and she put it into rehearsal at the Palace Theatre in London, with herself in the title-role. However, the Lord Chamberlain refused to grant it a licence, on the ground that no play which contained Biblical characters was allowed to be performed on the English stage. This so annoyed Wilde that he announced his intentions of renouncing his British nationality and becoming a Frenchman, there being no such restrictions in France. As matters turned out, it is a pity that he did not carry out his threat.\\nIn the summer of 1892 he wrote A Woman of No Importance, which was produced with immediate success by Herbert Beerbohm Tree at the Haymarket in 1893. Once again the audience rose to its feet and called for the author. This time remembering the bad impression he had made on t',\n",
              "  'he first night of Lady Windermere’s Fan, he got up in the box in which he was sitting and announced: ‘Ladies and Gentlemen, I regret to inform you that Mr Oscar Wilde is not in the house.’\\nOn 3 January 1895, Oscar Wilde’s third important play An Ideal Husband was produced by Lewis Waller. The Prince of Wales was present at the first night. It was almost unprecedented for Royalty to be present at a first night, and it seemed now that Wilde’s future was assured. George Bernard Shaw’s comment on the play is worth repeating: ‘Mr Oscar Wilde’s new play at the Haymarket is a dangerous subject, because he has the property of making his critics dull…He plays with everything; with wit, with philosophy, with drama, with actors and audience, with the whole theatre.’\\nAnd so we come to Oscar Wilde’s last, and his most brilliant play, The Importance of Being Earnest. Wilde originally wrote the play in four acts, as he had written his other three major plays. He submitted it in this form to George Alexander who, with the object of making room for a ‘curtain raiser’, as was usual in those days, asked Wilde to cut it to three acts. When, four years later, Leonard Smithers published the play in book form, it was this three-act version that he had printed, and each subsequent edition has followed this pattern. Why this has been so is not clear, but the play as written by Oscar Wilde, with two extra characters in it, is the play as given in this volume. As Mr Philip Drake, who is responsible for this edition of Wilde’s works, remarked, it seems a pity that George Alexander should have a permanent influence on the play.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Importance of Being Earnestwas produced at the St James’s Theatre on 14 February 1895. Wilde had now reached the pinnacle o',\n",
              "  'f his success. Two plays of his were drawing crowded audiences in the West End, and actormanagers were falling over one another to beg him to write for them. Then the Marquess of Queensberry, with the object of attacking his son, Lord Alfred Douglas, because of his friendship with Wilde, launched a campaign of ungovernable fury on Wilde. The story has been told often enough; Alfred Douglas, whose only object was to see his father in the dock, persuaded Oscar Wilde to bring a prosecution for criminal libel against him. Lord Queensberry was triumphantly acquitted and his place in the dock was taken by Oscar Wilde, who was sentenced to two years imprisonment.\\nWhile in prison, Wilde wrote the letter to Lord Alfred Douglas, part of which was published in 1905 by Robert Ross, under the title of De Profundis. In a letter to Robert Ross he wrote: ‘This is indeed an Encyclical letter, and as the Bulls of the Holy Father are named from their opening words, it may be spoken of as Epistola: in Carcere el Vinculis.’ The manuscript was not revised by Wilde, although he intended to do this, as is shown by the letter he wrote to Robert Ross: ‘As soon as you have read it, I want you to have it copied for me. As regards the method of copying, I wish the copy to be done on good paper and a wide rubricated margin should be left for corrections.’ A copy of De Profundis was made and sent to Alfred Douglas; but after reading the first few pages, he destroyed it, probably thinking, rather naively, that there was no other copy in existence. Douglas strenuously denied ever having received the letter, and he could not go back on this without contradicting himself.\\nAfter my father’s death in 1900, Alfred Douglas tried to get hold of the manuscript, but Ro',\n",
              "  'bert Ross settled the matter by sealing it up and presenting it to the British Museum, with the proviso that it should remain sealed for sixty years, that is to say until 1960, at the end of which time it might safely be presumed that everyone mentioned in it would be dead.\\nThe copying was done hastily and without much care, because the version printed in 1949 varied in several particulars from the original manuscript, although, of course, the substance was the same. The version here printed has been carefully compared with the original and is exactly as Wilde wrote it.\\nThe Portrait of Mr. W. H. was first published as an article of 12,000 words in Blackwood’s Magazine for July, 1889. Oscar Wilde became more and more obsessed with the idea contained in the article and during the next four years he re-wrote the story and added to it, bringing the total up to 25,000 words. The manuscript disappeared at the time of the sale of my father’s effects at Tite Street, together with others, and did not re-appear until the year 1920 in America, where it was published in a limited edition by Mitchell Kennerley. The expanded version is printed in this edition.\\nThe only work that my father wrote after 1897 was the poem The Ballad of Reading Gaol, which he wrote at Berneval, so that Douglas’s claim to have had a large share in writing it may be ignored, as he and Wilde did not meet again until later.\\nAll his life, my father had an intense leaning towards religious mysticism and was strongly attracted to the Catholic Church, into which he was received on his death bed in 1900. His remains now lie in the French National Cemetery of Pere Lachaise.\\nSOURCE: Complete Works of Oscar Wilde, with an introduction by Vyvyan Holland, Collins, 1966\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n'],\n",

Her interest in the folk culture of the South, influenced\\xa0by her studies with noted anthropologist Franz Boas, led to her return to Florida to study her native community and, eventually, to the work for which she is best known, the novel Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937).

Up to my thirteenth year I lived in the little Negro town of Eatonville, Florida. It is exclusively a colored town. The only white people I knew passed through the town going to or coming from Orlando. The native whites rode dusty horses, the Northern tourists chugged down the sandy village road in automobiles. The town knew the Southerners and never stopped cane chewing when they passed. But the Northerners were something else again. They were peered at cautiously from behind curtains by the timid. The more venturesome would come out on the porch to watch them go past and got just as much pleasure out of the tourists as the tourists got out of the village.\\nThe front porch might seem a daring place for the rest of the town, but it was a gallery seat for me.

I’d wave at them and when they returned my salute, I would say something like this: “Howdy-do-well-I-thank-you-where-you-goin’?’’ Usually automobile or the horse paused at this, and after a queer exchange of compliments, I would probably “go a piece of the way’’ with them, as we say in farthest Florida. If one of my family happened to come to the front in time to see me, of course negotiations would be rudely broken off. But even so, it is clear that I was the first “welcome-to-our-state” Floridian, and I hope the Miami Chamber of Commerce will please take notice.\\nDuring this period, white people differed from colored to me only in that they rode through town and never lived there.

              "[['\\n \\nIn Edgar Allan Poe’s The Fall of the House of Usher, the narrator describes a haunting visit to the eerie and decaying Usher mansion, where he encounters his childhood friend Roderick Usher, who suffers from acute anxiety and a morbid sensitivity to sensory stimuli. Roderick’s twin sister, Madeline, is gravely ill with a mysterious condition that leaves her cataleptic. The narrative unfolds in a gloomy atmosphere, filled with foreboding and supernatural elements, as the narrator witnesses the psychological disintegration of Roderick and the bizarre events leading up to Madeline’s death and terrifying return from the grave. The story culminates in the literal and metaphorical collapse of the Usher house into the dark tarn that mirrors it, symbolizing the end of the Usher family line and the inescapable doom of their ancient curse. Poe masterfully weaves themes of fear, isolation, and madness, creating a quintessential Gothic tale that explores the depths of human despair and the fragility of the psyche.\\n* * *\\nby Edgar Allan Poe\\nSon cœur est un luth suspendu;\\nSitôt qu’on le touche il résonne.\\n—De Béranger.1\\nDuring the whole of a dull, dark, and soundless day in the autumn of the year, when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens, I had been passing alone, on horseback, through a singularly dreary tract of country; and at length found myself, as the shades of the evening drew on, within view of the melancholy House of Usher. I know n',\n",
              "  'ot how it was – but, with the first glimpse of the building, a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit. I say insufferable; for the feeling was unrelieved by any of that half-pleasurable, because poetic, sentiment, with which the mind usually receives even the sternest natural images of the desolate or terrible. I looked upon the scene before me – upon the mere house, and the simple landscape features of the domain – upon the bleak walls – upon the vacant eye-like windows – upon a few rank sedges – and upon a few white trunks of decayed trees – with an utter depression of soul which I can compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the after-dream of the reveller upon opium – the bitter lapse into everyday life – the hideous dropping off of the veil. There was an iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the heart – an unredeemed dreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could torture into aught of the sublime. What was it – I paused to think – what was it that so unnerved me in the contemplation of the House of Usher? It was a mystery all insoluble; nor could I grapple with the shadowy fancies that crowded upon me as I pondered. I was forced to fall back upon the unsatisfactory conclusion, that while, beyond doubt, there are combinations of very simple natural objects which have the power of thus affecting us, still the analysis of this power lies among considerations beyond our depth. It was possible, I reflected,',\n",
              "  ' that a mere different arrangement of the particulars of the scene, of the details of the picture, would be sufficient to modify, or perhaps to annihilate its capacity for sorrowful impression; and, acting upon this idea, I reined my horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in unruffled lustre by the dwelling, and gazed down – but with a shudder even more thrilling than before – upon the remodelled and inverted images of the gray sedge, and the ghastly tree-stems, and the vacant and eye-like windows.\\nNevertheless, in this mansion of gloom I now proposed to myself a\\xa0sojourn\\xa0of some weeks. Its proprietor, Roderick Usher, had been one of my boon companions in boyhood; but many years had elapsed since our last meeting. A letter, however, had lately reached me in a distant part of the country – a letter from him – which, in its wildly importunate nature, had admitted of no other than a personal reply. The MS. gave evidence of nervous agitation. The writer spoke of\\xa0acute\\xa0bodily illness – of a mental disorder which oppressed him – and of an earnest desire to see me, as his best, and indeed his only personal friend, with a view of attempting, by the cheerfulness of my society, some alleviation of his malady. It was the manner in which all this, and much more, was said – it the apparent heart that went with his request – which allowed me no room for hesitation; and I accordingly obeyed forthwith what I still considered a very',\n",
              "  ' singular summons.\\nAlthough, as boys, we had been even intimate associates, yet I really knew little of my friend. His reserve had been always excessive and habitual. I was aware, however, that his very ancient family had been noted, time out of mind, for a peculiar sensibility of temperament, displaying itself, through long ages, in many works of exalted art, and manifested, of late, in repeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive charity, as well as in a passionate devotion to the intricacies, perhaps even more than to the orthodox and easily recognisable beauties, of musical science. I had learned, too, the very remarkable fact, that the stem of the Usher race, all time-honoured as it was, had put forth, at no period, any enduring branch; in other words, that the entire family lay in the direct line of descent, and had always, with very trifling and very temporary variation, so lain. It was this deficiency, I considered, while running over in thought the perfect keeping of the character of the premises with the accredited character of the people, and while speculating upon the possible influence which the one, in the long lapse of centuries, might have exercised upon the other – it was this deficiency, perhaps, of collateral issue, and the consequent undeviating transmission, from sire to son, of the patrimony with the name, which had, at length, so identified the two as to merge the original title of the estate in the quaint and\\xa0equivoca',\n",
              "  'l\\xa0appellation of the “House of Usher” – an appellation which seemed to include, in the minds of the peasantry who used it, both the family and the family mansion.\\nI have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish experiment – that of looking down within the\\xa0tarn – had been to deepen the first singular impression. There can be no doubt that the consciousness of the rapid increase of my superstition – for why should I not so term it? – served mainly to accelerate the increase itself. Such, I have long known, is the\\xa0paradoxical\\xa0law of all sentiments having terror as a basis. And it might have been for this reason only, that, when I again uplifted my eyes to the house itself, from its image in the pool, there grew in my mind a strange fancy – a fancy so ridiculous, indeed, that I but mention it to show the vivid force of the sensations which oppressed me. I had so worked upon my imagination as really to believe that about the whole mansion and domain there hung an atmosphere peculiar to themselves and their immediate vicinity-an atmosphere which had no affinity with the air of heaven, but which had reeked up from the decayed trees, and the gray wall, and the silent\\xa0tarn – a pestilent and mystic vapour, dull, sluggish, faintly discernible, and leaden-hued.\\nShaking off from my spirit what must have been a dream, I scanned more narrowly the real aspect of the building. Its principal feature seemed to be that of an excessive antiquity. The di',\n",
              "  'scoloration of ages had been great. Minute fungi overspread the whole exterior, hanging in a fine tangled web-work from the eaves. Yet all this was apart from any extraordinary dilapidation. No portion of the masonry had fallen; and there appeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfect adaptation of parts, and the crumbling condition of the individual stones. In this there was much that reminded me of the specious totality of old wood-work which has rotted for long years in some neglected vault, with no disturbance from the breath of the external air. Beyond this indication of extensive decay, however, the fabric gave little token of instability. Perhaps the eye of a scrutinising observer might have discovered a barely perceptible fissure, which, extending from the roof of the building in front, made its way down the wall in a zigzag direction, until it became lost in the\\xa0sullen\\xa0waters of the\\xa0tarn.\\nNoticing these things, I rode over a short causeway to the house. A servant in waiting took my horse, and I entered the Gothic archway of the hall. A valet, of stealthy step, thence conducted me, in silence, through many dark and intricate passages in my progress to the studio of his master. Much that I encountered on the way contributed, I know not how, to heighten the vague sentiments of which I have already spoken. While the objects around me – while the carvings of the ceilings, the sombre tapestries of the walls, the ebon blackn',\n",
              "  'ess of the floors, and the\\xa0phantasmagoric\\xa0armorial trophies which rattled as I strode, were but matters to which, or to such as which, I had been accustomed from my infancy – while I hesitated not to acknowledge how familiar was all this – I still wondered to find how unfamiliar were the fancies which ordinary images were stirring up. On one of the staircases, I met the physician of the family. His countenance, I thought, wore a mingled expression of low cunning and perplexity. He accosted me with\\xa0trepidation\\xa0and passed on. The valet now threw open a door and ushered me into the presence of his master.\\nThe room in which I found myself was very large and lofty. The windows were long, narrow, and pointed, and at so vast a distance from the black oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible from within. Feeble gleams of encrimsoned light made their way through the trellised panes, and served to render sufficiently distinct the more prominent objects around; the eye, however, struggled in vain to reach the remoter angles of the chamber, or the recesses of the vaulted and fretted ceiling. Dark draperies hung upon the walls. The general furniture was profuse, comfortless, antique, and tattered. Many books and musical instruments lay scattered about, but failed to give any vitality to the scene. I felt that I breathed an atmosphere of sorrow. An air of stern, deep, and irredeemable gloom hung over and pervaded all.\\nUpon my entrance, Usher arose fro',\n",
              "  'm a sofa on which he had been lying at full length, and greeted me with a vivacious warmth which had much in it, I at first thought, of an overdone cordiality – of the constrained effort of the ennuyé man of the world. A glance, however, at his countenance, convinced me of his perfect sincerity. We sat down; and for some moments, while he spoke not, I gazed upon him with a feeling half of pity, half of awe. Surely, man had never before so terribly altered, in so brief a period, as had Roderick Usher! It was with difficulty that I could bring myself to admit the identity of the wan being before me with the companion of my early boyhood. Yet the character of his face had been at all times remarkable. A cadaverousness of complexion; an eye large, liquid, and luminous beyond comparison; lips somewhat thin and very pallid, but of a surpassingly beautiful curve; a nose of a delicate Hebrew model, but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations; a finely moulded chin, speaking, in its want of prominence, of a want of moral energy; hair of a more than web-like softness and tenuity; these features, with an inordinate expansion above the regions of the temple, made up altogether a countenance not easily to be forgotten. And now in the mere exaggeration of the prevailing character of these features, and of the expression they were wont to convey, lay so much of change that I doubted to whom I spoke. The now ghastly pallor of the skin, and t',\n",
              "  'he now miraculous lustre of the eve, above all things startled and even awed me. The silken hair, too, had been suffered to grow all unheeded, and as, in its wild gossamer texture, it floated rather than fell about the face, I could not, even with effort, connect its Arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity.\\nIn the manner of my friend I was at once struck with an incoherence – an inconsistency; and I soon found this to arise from a series of feeble and futile struggles to overcome an habitual trepidancy – an excessive nervous agitation. For something of this nature I had indeed been prepared, no less by his letter, than by reminiscences of certain boyish traits, and by conclusions deduced from his peculiar physical conformation and temperament. His action was alternately vivacious and\\xa0sullen. His voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision (when the animal spirits seemed utterly in\\xa0abeyance) to that species of energetic concision – that abrupt, weighty, unhurried, and hollow-sounding enunciation – that leaden, self-balanced and perfectly modulated guttural utterance, which may be observed in the lost drunkard, or the irreclaimable eater of opium, during the periods of his most intense excitement.\\nIt was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit, of his earnest desire to see me, and of the solace he expected me to afford him. He entered, at some length, into what he conceived to be the nature of his malady. It was, he sai',\n",
              "  'd, a constitutional and a family evil, and one for which he despaired to find a remedy – a mere nervous affection, he immediately added, which would undoubtedly soon pass off. It displayed itself in a host of unnatural sensations. Some of these, as he detailed them, interested and bewildered me; although, perhaps, the terms, and the general manner of the narration had their weight. He suffered much from a morbid acuteness of the senses; the most insipid food was alone endurable; he could wear only garments of certain texture; the odours of all flowers were oppressive; his eyes were tortured by even a faint light; and there were but peculiar sounds, and these from stringed instruments, which did not inspire him with horror.\\nTo an\\xa0anomalous\\xa0species of terror I found him a bounden slave. “I shall perish,” said he, “I must perish in this deplorable folly. Thus, thus, and not otherwise, shall I be lost. I dread the events of the future, not in themselves, but in their results. I shudder at the thought of any, even the most trivial, incident, which may operate upon this intolerable agitation of soul. I have, indeed, no abhorrence of danger, except in its absolute effect – in terror. In this unnerved-in this pitiable condition – I feel that the period will sooner or later arrive when I must abandon life and reason together, in some struggle with the grim\\xa0phantasm, FEAR.”\\nI learned, moreover, at intervals, and through broken and\\xa0equivocal\\xa0hints, ano',\n",
              "  'ther singular feature of his mental condition. He was enchained by certain superstitious impressions in regard to the dwelling which he tenanted, and whence, for many years, he had never ventured forth – in regard to an influence whose supposititious force was conveyed in terms too shadowy here to be re-stated – an influence which some peculiarities in the mere form and substance of his family mansion, had, by\\xa0dint\\xa0of long sufferance, he said, obtained over his spirit-an effect which the physique of the gray walls and turrets, and of the dim\\xa0tarn\\xa0into which they all looked down, had, at length, brought about upon the morale of his existence.\\nHe admitted, however, although with hesitation, that much of the peculiar gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a more natural and far more\\xa0palpable\\xa0origin – to the severe and long-continued illness – indeed to the evidently approaching dissolution-of a tenderly beloved sister – his sole companion for long years – his last and only relative on earth. “Her decease,” he said, with a bitterness which I can never forget, “would leave him (him the hopeless and the frail) the last of the ancient race of the Ushers.” While he spoke, the lady Madeline (for so was she called) passed slowly through a remote portion of the apartment, and, without having noticed my presence, disappeared. I regarded her with an utter astonishment not unmingled with dread – and yet I found it impossible to account for such',\n",
              "  ' feelings. A sensation of stupor oppressed me, as my eyes followed her retreating steps. When a door, at length, closed upon her, my glance sought instinctively and eagerly the countenance of the brother – but he had buried his face in his hands, and I could only perceive that a far more than ordinary wanness had overspread the emaciated fingers through which trickled many passionate tears.\\nThe disease of the lady Madeline had long baffled the skill of her physicians. A settled apathy, a gradual wasting away of the person, and frequent although transient affections of a partially\\xa0cataleptical\\xa0character, were the unusual diagnosis. Hitherto she had steadily borne up against the pressure of her malady, and had not betaken herself finally to bed; but, on the closing in of the evening of my arrival at the house, she succumbed (as her brother told me at night with inexpressible agitation) to the prostrating power of the destroyer; and I learned that the glimpse I had obtained of her person would thus probably be the last I should obtain – that the lady, at least while living, would be seen by me no more.\\nFor several days ensuing, her name was unmentioned by either Usher or myself: and during this period I was busied in earnest endeavours to alleviate the melancholy of my friend. We painted and read together; or I listened, as if in a dream, to the wild improvisations of his speaking guitar. And thus, as a closer and still intimacy admitted me mor',\n",

Yet I should fail in any attempt to convey an idea of the exact character of the studies, or of the occupations, in which he involved me, or led me the way. An excited and highly distempered ideality threw a\\xa0sulphureous\\xa0lustre over all. His long improvised dirges will ring forever in my ears. Among other things, I hold painfully in mind a certain singular perversion and amplification of the wild air of the last waltz of Von Weber. From the paintings over which his elaborate fancy brooded, and which grew, touch by touch, into vaguenesses at which I shuddered the more thrillingly, because I shuddered knowing not why; – from these paintings (vivid as their images now are before me) I would in vain endeavour to educe more than a small portion which should lie within the compass of merely written words. By the utter simplicity, by the nakedness of his designs, he arrested and overawed attention. If ever mortal painted an idea, that mortal was Roderick Usher. For me at least – in the circumstances then surrounding me – there arose out of the pure a',\n",

A small picture presented the interior of an immensely long and rectangular vault or tunnel, with low walls, smooth, white, and without interruption or device. Certain accessory points of the design served well to convey the idea that this excavation lay at an exceeding depth below the surface of the earth. No outlet was observed in any portion of its vast extent, and no torch, or other artificial source of light was discernible; yet a flood of intense rays rolled throughout, and bathed the whole in a ghastly and inappropriate splendour.\\nI have just spoken of that morbid condition of the auditory nerve which rendered all music intolerable to the sufferer, with the exception of certain effects of stringed instruments. It was, perhaps, the narrow limits to which he thus confined himself upon the guitar, which gave birth, in great measure, to the fantastic character of his performances. But the fervid facility of his impromptus could not be so accounted for. They must have been, and were, in the notes, as well as in the words of his wild fantasias (for he not unfrequently',\n",
              "  ' accompanied himself with rhymed verbal improvisations), the result of that intense mental collectedness and concentration to which I have previously alluded as observable only in particular moments of the highest artificial excitement. The words of one of these rhapsodies I have easily remembered. I was, perhaps, the more forcibly impressed with it, as he gave it, because, in the under or mystic current of its meaning, I fancied that I perceived, and for the first time, a full consciousness on the part of Usher, of the tottering of his lofty reason upon her throne. The verses, which were entitled “The Haunted Palace,” ran very nearly, if not accurately, thus:\\nI.\\nIn the greenest of our valleys,\\nBy good angels tenanted,\\nOnce fair and stately palace –\\nRadiant palace – reared its head.\\nIn the monarch Thought’s dominion –\\nIt stood there!\\nNever seraph spread a pinion\\nOver fabric half so fair.\\nII.\\n\\n\\n\\nBanners yellow, glorious, golden,\\nOn its roof did float and flow;\\n(This – all this – was in the olden\\nTime long ago)\\nAnd every gentle air that dallied,\\nIn that sweet day,\\nAlong the ramparts plumed and\\xa0pallid,\\nA winged odour went away.\\nIII.\\nWanderers in that happy valley\\nThrough two luminous windows saw\\nSpirits moving musically\\nTo a lute’s well-tuned law,\\nRound about a throne, where sitting\\n(Porphyrogene!)\\nIn state his glory well befitting,\\nThe ruler of the realm was seen.\\nIV.\\nAnd all with pearl and ruby glowing\\nWas the fair palace door,\\nThrough which ',\n",

This opinion, in its general form, was that of the sentience of all vegetable things. But, in his disordered fancy, the idea had assumed a more daring character, and trespassed, under certain conditions, upon the kingdom of inorganization. I lack words to express the full extent, or the earnest abandon of his persuasion. The belief, however, was connected (as I have previously hinted) with the gray stones of the home of his forefathers. The conditions of the sentience h',\n",

Its evidence – the evidence of the sentience – was to be seen, he said, (and I here started as he spoke,) in the gradual yet certain condensation of an atmosphere of their own about the waters and the walls. The result was discoverable, he added, in that silent, yet importunate and terrible influence which for centuries had moulded the destinies of his family, and which made him what I now saw him – what he was. Such opinions need no comment, and I will make none.\\nOur books – the books which, for years, had formed no small portion of the mental existence of the invalid – were, as might be supposed, in strict keeping with this character of\\xa0phantasm. We pored together over such works as the\\xa0Ververt et Chartreuse\\xa0of Gresset; the\\xa0Belphegor\\xa0of\\xa0Machiavelli; the Heaven and Hell of\\xa0Swedenborg; the Subterranean Voyage of\\xa0Nicholas Klimm\\xa0by Holberg; the\\xa0Chiromancy of Robert Flud, of Jean D’Indaginé, and of De la Chambre; the Journey into the\\xa0Blue Distance of Tieck; and the City of the Sun of\\xa0Campanella. One favourite volume was a small octavo edition of the\\xa0Directorium Inquisitorum, by the Dominican Eymeric de',\n",
              "  ' Gironne; and there were passages in Pomponius Mela, about the old African Satyrs and Ægipans, over which Usher would sit dreaming for hours. His chief delight, however, was found in the perusal of an exceedingly rare and curious book in quarto Gothic – the manual of a forgotten church – the Vigilae Mortuorum secundum Chorum Ecclesiae Maguntinae.\\nI could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work, and of its probable influence upon the hypochondriac, when, one evening, having informed me abruptly that the lady Madeline was no more, he stated his intention of preserving her corpse for a\\xa0fortnight, (previously to its final interment,) in one of the numerous vaults within the main walls of the building. The worldly reason, however, assigned for this singular proceeding, was one which I did not feel at liberty to dispute. The brother had been led to his resolution (so he told me) by consideration of the unusual character of the malady of the deceased, of certain obtrusive and eager inquiries on the part of her medical men, and of the remote and exposed situation of the burial-ground of the family. I will not deny that when I called to mind the sinister countenance of the person whom I met upon the stair case, on the day of my arrival at the house, I had no desire to oppose what I regarded as at best but a harmless, and by no means an unnatural, precaution.\\nAt the request of Usher, I personally aided him in the arrangements for the tempora',\n",
              "  'ry entombment. The body having been encoffined, we two alone bore it to its rest. The vault in which we placed it (and which had been so long unopened that our torches, half smothered in its oppressive atmosphere, gave us little opportunity for investigation) was small, damp, and entirely without means of admission for light; lying, at great depth, immediately beneath that portion of the building in which was my own sleeping apartment. It had been used, apparently, in remote feudal times, for the worst purposes of a\\xa0donjon-keep, and, in later days, as a place of deposit for powder, or some other highly combustible substance, as a portion of its floor, and the whole interior of a long archway through which we reached it, were carefully sheathed with copper. The door, of massive iron, had been, also, similarly protected. Its immense weight caused an unusually sharp grating sound, as it moved upon its hinges.\\nHaving deposited our mournful burden upon tressels within this region of horror, we partially turned aside the yet unscrewed lid of the coffin, and looked upon the face of the tenant. A striking similitude between the brother and sister now first arrested my attention; and Usher, divining, perhaps, my thoughts, murmured out some few words from which I learned that the deceased and himself had been twins, and that sympathies of a scarcely intelligible nature had always existed between them. Our glances, however, rested not long upon the dea',\n",

The disease which had thus entombed the lady in the maturity of youth, had left, as usual in all maladies of a strictly\\xa0cataleptical\\xa0character, the mockery of a faint blush upon the bosom and the face, and that suspiciously lingering smile upon the lip which is so terrible in death. We replaced and screwed down the lid, and, having secured the door of iron, made our way, with toll, into the scarcely less gloomy apartments of the upper portion of the house.\\nAnd now, some days of bitter grief having elapsed, an observable change came over the features of the mental disorder of my friend. His ordinary manner had vanished. His ordinary occupations were neglected or forgotten. He roamed from chamber to chamber with hurried, unequal, and objectless step. The pallor of his countenance had assumed, if possible, a more ghastly hue – but the luminousness of his eye had utterly gone out. The once occasional huskiness of his tone was heard no more; and a tremulous quaver, as if of extreme terror, habitually characterized his utterance. There were times, indeed, when I thought his unceasingly agitated mind was labouring with some oppressive secret, to divulge which he struggled for the necessary courage. At times, again, I was obliged to resolve all into the mere inexplicable vagaries of madness, for I beheld him gazing upon vacancy for long hours, in an attitude of the profoundest attention, as if listening to som',\n",

I felt creeping upon me, by slow yet certain degrees, the wild influences of his own fantastic yet impressive superstitions.\\nIt was, especially, upon retiring to bed late in the night of the seventh or eighth day after the placing of the lady Madeline within the donjon, that I experienced the full power of such feelings. Sleep came not near my couch – while the hours waned and waned away. I struggled to reason off the nervousness which had dominion over me. I endeavoured to believe that much, if not all of what I felt, was due to the bewildering influence of the gloomy furniture of the room – of the dark and tattered draperies, which, tortured into motion by the breath of a rising\\xa0tempest, swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls, and rustled uneasily about the decorations of the bed. But my efforts were fruitless. An irrepressible tremour gradually pervaded my frame; and, at length, there sat upon my very heart an\\xa0incubus\\xa0of utterly causeless alarm. Shaking this off with a gasp and a struggle, I uplifted myself upon the pillows, and, peering earnestly within the intense darkness of the chamber, hearkened – I know not why, except that an instinctive spirit prompted me – to certain low and indefinite sounds which came, through the pauses of the storm, at long intervals, I knew not whence. Overpowered by an intense sentiment of horror, unaccountable yet unen',\n",
              "  'durable, I threw on my clothes with haste (for I felt that I should sleep no more during the night), and endeavoured to arouse myself from the pitiable condition into which I had fallen, by pacing rapidly to and fro through the apartment.\\nI had taken but few turns in this manner, when a light step on an adjoining staircase arrested my attention. I presently recognised it as that of Usher. In an instant afterward he rapped, with a gentle touch, at my door, and entered, bearing a lamp. His countenance was, as usual,\\xa0cadaverously\\xa0wan – but, moreover, there was a species of mad hilarity in his eyes – an evidently restrained hysteria in his whole demeanour. His air appalled me – but anything was preferable to the solitude which I had so long endured, and I even welcomed his presence as a relief.\\n“And you have not seen it?” he said abruptly, after having stared about him for some moments in silence – “you have not then seen it? – but, stay! you shall.” Thus speaking, and having carefully shaded his lamp, he hurried to one of the casements, and threw it freely open to the storm.\\nThe impetuous fury of the entering gust nearly lifted us from our feet. It was, indeed, a\\xa0tempestuous\\xa0yet sternly beautiful night, and one wildly singular in its terror and its beauty. A whirlwind had apparently collected its force in our vicinity; for there were frequent and violent alterations in the direction of the wind; and the exceeding density of the clouds (which hu',\n",
              "  'ng so low as to press upon the turrets of the house) did not prevent our perceiving the life-like velocity with which they flew careering from all points against each other, without passing away into the distance. I say that even their exceeding density did not prevent our perceiving this – yet we had no glimpse of the moon or stars – nor was there any flashing forth of the lightning. But the under surfaces of the huge masses of agitated vapour, as well as all terrestrial objects immediately around us, were glowing in the unnatural light of a faintly luminous and distinctly visible gaseous exhalation which hung about and enshrouded the mansion.\\n“You must not – you shall not behold this!” said I, shudderingly, to Usher, as I led him, with a gentle violence, from the window to a seat. “These appearances, which bewilder you, are merely electrical phenomena not uncommon – or it may be that they have their ghastly origin in the rank miasma of the\\xa0tarn. Let us close this casement; – the air is chilling and dangerous to your frame. Here is one of your favourite romances. I will read, and you shall listen; – and so we will pass away this terrible night together.”\\nThe antique volume which I had taken up was the Mad Trist of Sir Launcelot Canning; but I had called it a favourite of Usher’s more in sad jest than in earnest; for, in truth, there is little in its uncouth and unimaginative prolixity which could have had interest for the lofty and spiritua',\n",

It was, however, the only book immediately at hand; and I indulged a vague hope that the excitement which now agitated the hypochondriac, might find relief (for the history of mental disorder is full of similar anomalies) even in the extremeness of the folly which I should read. Could I have judged, indeed, by the wild over-strained air of vivacity with which he hearkened, or apparently hearkened, to the words of the tale, I might well have congratulated myself upon the success of my design.\\nI had arrived at that well-known portion of the story where Ethelred, the hero of the Trist, having sought in vain for peaceable admission into the dwelling of the hermit, proceeds to make good an entrance by force. Here, it will be remembered, the words of the narrative run thus:\\n“And Ethelred, who was by nature of a doughty heart, and who was now mighty withal, on account of the powerfulness of the wine which he had drunken, waited no longer to hold parley with the hermit, who,\\xa0in sooth, was of an obstinate and maliceful turn, but, feeling the rain upon his shoulders, and fearing the rising of the\\xa0tempest, uplifted his mace outright, and, with blows, made quickly room in the plankings of the door for his gauntleted hand; and now pulling there-with sturdily, he so cracked, and ripped, and tore all asunder, that the noise of the dry and hollow-sounding wood alarumed and reverberated throughout the forest.\\nAt the termination of th',\n",
              "  'is sentence I started, and for a moment, paused; for it appeared to me (although I at once concluded that my excited fancy had deceived me) – it appeared to me that, from some very remote portion of the mansion, there came, indistinctly, to my ears, what might have been, in its exact similarity of character, the echo (but a stifled and dull one certainly) of the very cracking and ripping sound which Sir Launcelot had so particularly described. It was, beyond doubt, the coincidence alone which had arrested my attention; for, amid the rattling of the sashes of the casements, and the ordinary commingled noises of the still increasing storm, the sound, in itself, had nothing, surely, which should have interested or disturbed me. I continued the story:\\n“But the good champion Ethelred, now entering within the door, was sore enraged and amazed to perceive no signal of the maliceful hermit; but, in the stead thereof, a dragon of a scaly and\\xa0prodigious\\xa0demeanour, and of a fiery tongue, which\\xa0sate\\xa0in guard before a palace of gold, with a floor of silver; and upon the wall there hung a shield of shining brass with this legend enwritten –\\n\\n\\n\\nWho entereth herein, a conqueror hath bin;\\nWho slayeth the dragon, the shield he shall win;\\nand Ethelred uplifted his mace, and struck upon the head of the dragon, which fell before him, and gave up his pesty breath, with a shriek so horrid and harsh, and withal so piercing, that Ethelred had fain to close his ears ',\n",
              "  'with his hands against the dreadful noise of it, the like whereof was never before heard.”\\nHere again I paused abruptly, and now with a feeling of wild amazement – for there could be no doubt whatever that, in this instance, I did actually hear (although from what direction it proceeded I found it impossible to say) a low and apparently distant, but harsh, protracted, and most unusual screaming or grating sound – the exact counterpart of what my fancy had already conjured up for the dragon’s unnatural shriek as described by the romancer.\\nOppressed, as I certainly was, upon the occurrence of the second and most extraordinary coincidence, by a thousand conflicting sensations, in which wonder and extreme terror were predominant, I still retained sufficient presence of mind to avoid exciting, by any observation, the sensitive nervousness of my companion. I was by no means certain that he had noticed the sounds in question; although, assuredly, a strange alteration had, during the last few minutes, taken place in his demeanour. From a position fronting my own, he had gradually brought round his chair, so as to sit with his face to the door of the chamber; and thus I could but partially perceive his features, although I saw that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring inaudibly.

His eyes were bent fixedly before him, and throughout his whole countenance there reigned a stony rigidity.

              "  'NOTES\\n1. The epigraph at the beginning of Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Fall of the House of Usher,” taken from a poem by Pierre Jean de Béranger, serves as a metaphorical preface to the story’s themes and atmosphere. The lines, “Son cœur est un luth suspendu; Sitôt qu’on le touche il résonne,” translate to “His heart is a lute suspended; As soon as one touches it, it resonates.”\\nThis epigraph suggests a sensitivity to external influences, symbolizing the delicate and responsive nature of the human psyche. In the context of the story, it foreshadows the intense emotional and psychological states of the characters, particularly Roderick Usher, whose mental and physical condition is highly susceptible to his environment. The Usher family home, a Gothic mansion that is almost a character in its own right, acts as an external embodiment of Roderick’s internal state, with its decaying structure mirroring his deteriorating mind. The epigraph hints at the central themes of the story: the interplay between the physical and psychological, the impact of the past on the present, and the idea that both the human mind and the environments we inhabit are easily affected by stimuli, capable of producing profound reactions to seemingly minor provocations. It sets the stage for a tale where atmosphere, setting, and emotion resonate together, much like the strings of a lute respond to a touch.\\n2.

Why this has been so is not clear, but the play as written by Oscar Wilde, with two extra characters in it, is the play as given in this volume. As Mr Philip Drake, who is responsible for this edition of Wilde’s works, remarked, it seems a pity that George Alexander should have a permanent influence on the play.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Importance of Being Earnestwas produced at the St James’s Theatre on 14 February 1895.

Then the Marquess of Queensberry, with the object of attacking his son, Lord Alfred Douglas, because of his friendship with Wilde, launched a campaign of ungovernable fury on Wilde.

In a letter to Robert Ross he wrote: ‘This is indeed an Encyclical letter, and as the Bulls of the Holy Father are named from their opening words, it may be spoken of as Epistola: in Carcere el Vinculis.’ The manuscript was not revised by Wilde, although he intended to do this, as is shown by the letter he wrote to Robert Ross: ‘As soon a',\n",

Douglas strenuously denied ever having received the letter, and he could not go back on this without contradicting himself.\\nAfter my father’s death in 1900, Alfred Douglas tried to get hold of the ',\n",
